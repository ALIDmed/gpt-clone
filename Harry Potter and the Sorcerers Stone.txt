M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people youâ€™d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didnâ€™t hold with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didnâ€™t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursleyâ€™s sister, but they hadnâ€™t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didnâ€™t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didnâ€™t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.

â€œLittle tyke,â€ chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number fourâ€™s drive.

It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar â€” a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didnâ€™t realize what he had seen â€” then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasnâ€™t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive â€” no, looking at the sign; cats couldnâ€™t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.

But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldnâ€™t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldnâ€™t bear people who dressed in funny clothes â€” the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werenâ€™t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt â€”these people were obviously collecting for somethingâ€¦yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.

Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadnâ€™t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didnâ€™t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought heâ€™d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.

Heâ€™d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakerâ€™s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didnâ€™t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldnâ€™t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.

â€œThe Potters, thatâ€™s right, thatâ€™s what I heard â€”â€

â€œ â€” yes, their son, Harry â€”â€

Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.

He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinkingâ€¦no, he was being stupid. Potter wasnâ€™t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasnâ€™t even sure his nephew was called Harry. Heâ€™d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didnâ€™t blame her â€” if heâ€™d had a sister like thatâ€¦but all the same, those people in cloaks.â€¦

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oâ€™clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.

â€œSorry,â€ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didnâ€™t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, â€œDonâ€™t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!â€

And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.

Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didnâ€™t approve of imagination.

As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw â€” and it didnâ€™t improve his mood â€” was the tabby cat heâ€™d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.

â€œShoo!â€ said Mr. Dursley loudly.

The cat didnâ€™t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.

Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Doorâ€™s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (â€œWonâ€™t!â€). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:

â€œAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nationâ€™s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.â€ The newscaster allowed himself a grin. â€œMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?â€

â€œWell, Ted,â€ said the weatherman, â€œI donâ€™t know about that, but itâ€™s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, theyâ€™ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early â€” itâ€™s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.â€

Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters.â€¦

Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. Heâ€™d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. â€œEr â€” Petunia, dear â€” you havenâ€™t heard from your sister lately, have you?â€

As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didnâ€™t have a sister.

â€œNo,â€ she said sharply. â€œWhy?â€

â€œFunny stuff on the news,â€ Mr. Dursley mumbled. â€œOwlsâ€¦shooting starsâ€¦and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.â€¦â€

â€œSo?â€ snapped Mrs. Dursley.

â€œWell, I just thoughtâ€¦maybeâ€¦it was something to do withâ€¦you knowâ€¦her crowd.â€

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her heâ€™d heard the name â€œPotter.â€ He decided he didnâ€™t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, â€œTheir son â€” heâ€™d be about Dudleyâ€™s age now, wouldnâ€™t he?â€

â€œI suppose so,â€ said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.

â€œWhatâ€™s his name again? Howard, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.â€

â€œOh, yes,â€ said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. â€œYes, I quite agree.â€

He didnâ€™t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.

Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of â€” well, he didnâ€™t think he could bear it.

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldnâ€™t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on â€” he yawned and turned over â€” it couldnâ€™t affect them.â€¦

How very wrong he was.

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didnâ€™t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently youâ€™d have thought heâ€™d just popped out of the ground. The catâ€™s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This manâ€™s name was Albus Dumbledore.

Albus Dumbledore didnâ€™t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, â€œI should have known.â€

He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again â€” the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldnâ€™t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didnâ€™t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.

â€œFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.â€

He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.

â€œHow did you know it was me?â€ she asked.

â€œMy dear Professor, Iâ€™ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.â€

â€œYouâ€™d be stiff if youâ€™d been sitting on a brick wall all day,â€ said Professor McGonagall.

â€œAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.â€

Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

â€œOh yes, Iâ€™ve celebrating, all right,â€ she said impatiently. â€œYouâ€™d think theyâ€™d be a bit more careful, but no â€”even the Muggles have noticed somethingâ€™s going on. It was on their news.â€ She jerked her head back at the Dursleysâ€™ dark living-room window. â€œI heard it. Flocks of owlsâ€¦shooting starsâ€¦Well, theyâ€™re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent â€” Iâ€™ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.â€

â€œYou canâ€™t blame them,â€ said Dumbledore gently. â€œWeâ€™ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.â€

â€œI know that,â€ said Professor McGonagall irritably. â€œBut thatâ€™s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.â€

She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didnâ€™t, so she went on. â€œA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?â€

â€œIt certainly seems so,â€ said Dumbledore. â€œWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?â€

â€œA what?â€

â€œA lemon drop. Theyâ€™re a kind of Muggle sweet Iâ€™m rather fond of.â€

â€œNo, thank you,â€ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didnâ€™t think this was the moment for lemon drops. â€œAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone â€”â€

â€œMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this â€˜You-Know-Whoâ€™ nonsense â€” for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.â€ Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. â€œIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying â€˜You-Know-Who.â€™ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemortâ€™s name.â€

â€œI know you havenâ€™t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. â€œBut youâ€™re different. Everyone knows youâ€™re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.â€

â€œYou flatter me,â€ said Dumbledore calmly. â€œVoldemort had powers I will never have.â€

â€œOnly because youâ€™re too â€” well â€” noble to use them.â€

â€œItâ€™s lucky itâ€™s dark. I havenâ€™t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.â€

Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said â€œThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what theyâ€™re saying? About why heâ€™s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?â€

It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever â€œeveryoneâ€ was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.

â€œWhat theyâ€™re saying,â€ she pressed on, â€œis that last night Voldemort turned up in Godricâ€™s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are â€” are â€” that theyâ€™re â€” dead.â€

Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.

â€œLily and Jamesâ€¦I canâ€™t believe itâ€¦I didnâ€™t want to believe itâ€¦Oh, Albusâ€¦â€

Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. â€œI knowâ€¦I knowâ€¦â€ he said heavily.

Professor McGonagallâ€™s voice trembled as she went on. â€œThatâ€™s not all. Theyâ€™re saying he tried to kill the Potterâ€™s son, Harry. But he couldnâ€™t. He couldnâ€™t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but theyâ€™re saying that when he couldnâ€™t kill Harry Potter, Voldemortâ€™s power somehow broke â€” and thatâ€™s why heâ€™s gone.â€

Dumbledore nodded glumly.

â€œItâ€™s â€” itâ€™s true?â€ faltered Professor McGonagall. â€œAfter all heâ€™s doneâ€¦all the people heâ€™s killedâ€¦he couldnâ€™t kill a little boy? Itâ€™s just astoundingâ€¦of all the things to stop himâ€¦but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?â€

â€œWe can only guess.â€ said Dumbledore. â€œWe may never know.â€

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, â€œHagridâ€™s late. I suppose it was he who told you Iâ€™d be here, by the way?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Professor McGonagall. â€œAnd I donâ€™t suppose youâ€™re going to tell me why youâ€™re here, of all places?â€

â€œIâ€™ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. Theyâ€™re the only family he has left now.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t mean â€“ you canâ€™t mean the people who live here?â€ cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. â€œDumbledore â€” you canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been watching them all day. You couldnâ€™t find two people who are less like us. And theyâ€™ve got this son â€” I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!â€

â€œItâ€™s the best place for him,â€ said Dumbledore firmly. â€œHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when heâ€™s older. Iâ€™ve written them a letter.â€

â€œA letter?â€ repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. â€œReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! Heâ€™ll be famous â€” a legend â€” I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future â€” there will be books written about Harry â€” every child in our world will know his name!â€

â€œExactly.â€ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. â€œIt would be enough to turn any boyâ€™s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he wonâ€™t even remember! Can you see how much better off heâ€™ll be, growing up away from all that until heâ€™s ready to take it?â€

Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, â€œYes â€” yes, youâ€™re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?â€ She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.

â€œHagridâ€™s bringing him.â€

â€œYou think it â€” wise â€” to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?â€

â€œI would trust Hagrid with my life,â€ said Dumbledore.

â€œIâ€™m not saying his heart isnâ€™t in the right place,â€ said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, â€œbut you canâ€™t pretend heâ€™s not careless. He does tend to â€” what was that?â€

A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky â€” and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.

If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild â€” long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.

â€œHagrid,â€ said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. â€œAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?â€

â€œBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,â€ said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. â€œYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. Iâ€™ve got him, sir.â€

â€œNo problems, were there?â€

â€œNo, sir â€” house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarminâ€™ around. He fell asleep as we was flyinâ€™ over Bristol.â€

Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.

â€œIs that where â€”?â€ whispered Professor McGonagall.

â€œYes,â€ said Dumbledore. â€œHeâ€™ll have that scar forever.â€

â€œCouldnâ€™t you do something about it, Dumbledore?â€

â€œEven if I could, I wouldnâ€™t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well â€” give him here, Hagrid â€” weâ€™d better get this over with.â€

Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleysâ€™ house.

â€œCould I â€” could I say good-bye to him, sir?â€ asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.

â€œShhh!â€ hissed Professor McGonagall, â€œYouâ€™ll wake the Muggles!â€

â€œS-s-sorry,â€ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. â€œBut I c-c-canâ€™t stand it â€”Lily anâ€™ James dead â€” anâ€™ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles â€”â€

â€œYes, yes, itâ€™s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or weâ€™ll be found,â€ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harryâ€™s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagridâ€™s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledoreâ€™s eyes seemed to have gone out.

â€œWell,â€ said Dumbledore finally, â€œthatâ€™s that. Weâ€™ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.â€

â€œYeah,â€ said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, â€œIâ€™ll be takinâ€™ Sirius his bike back. Gâ€™night, Professor McGonagall â€” Professor Dumbledore, sir.â€

Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.

â€œI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,â€ said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.

Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.

â€œGood luck, Harry,â€ he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hoursâ€™ time by Mrs. Dursleyâ€™s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldnâ€™t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: â€œTo Harry Potter â€” the boy who lived!â€

CHAPTER TWO




THE VANISHING GLASS



N early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleysâ€™ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets â€” but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.

Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.

â€œUp! Get up! Now!â€

Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.

â€œUp!â€ she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling heâ€™d had the same dream before.

His aunt was back outside the door.

â€œAre you up yet?â€ she demanded.

â€œNearly,â€ said Harry.

â€œWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And donâ€™t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddyâ€™s birthday.â€

Harry groaned.

â€œWhat did you say?â€ his aunt snapped through the door.

â€œNothing, nothingâ€¦â€

Dudleyâ€™s birthday â€” how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudleyâ€™s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise â€” unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudleyâ€™s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldnâ€™t often catch him. Harry didnâ€™t look it, but he was very fast.

Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudleyâ€™s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

â€œIn the car crash when your parents died,â€ she had said. â€œAnd donâ€™t ask questions.â€

Donâ€™t ask questions â€” that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.

Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.

â€œComb your hair!â€ he barked, by way of a morning greeting.

About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way â€” all over the place.

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel â€” Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.

Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasnâ€™t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.

â€œThirty-six,â€ he said, looking up at his mother and father. â€œThatâ€™s two less than last year.â€

â€œDarling, you havenâ€™t counted Auntie Margeâ€™s present, see, itâ€™s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.â€

â€œAll right, thirty-seven then,â€ said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.

Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, â€œAnd weâ€™ll buy you another two presents while weâ€™re out today. Howâ€™s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all rightâ€

Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, â€œSo Iâ€™ll have thirty...thirty...â€

â€œThirty-nine, sweetums,â€ said Aunt Petunia.

â€œOh.â€ Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. â€œAll right then.â€

Uncle Vernon chuckled.

â€œLittle tyke wants his moneyâ€™s worth, just like his father. â€™Atta boy, Dudley!â€ He ruffled Dudleyâ€™s hair.

At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.

â€œBad news, Vernon,â€ she said. â€œMrs. Figgâ€™s broken her leg. She canâ€™t take him.â€ She jerked her head in Harryâ€™s direction.

Dudleyâ€™s mouth fell open in horror, but Harryâ€™s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudleyâ€™s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats sheâ€™d ever owned.

â€œNow what?â€ said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though heâ€™d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasnâ€™t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.

â€œWe could phone Marge,â€ Uncle Vernon suggested.

â€œDonâ€™t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.â€

The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasnâ€™t there â€” or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldnâ€™t understand them, like a slug.

â€œWhat about whatâ€™s-her-name, your friend â€” Yvonne?â€

â€œOn vacation in Majorca,â€ snapped Aunt Petunia.

â€œYou could just leave me here,â€ Harry put in hopefully (heâ€™d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudleyâ€™s computer).

Aunt Petunia looked as though sheâ€™d just swallowed a lemon.

â€œAnd come back and find the house in ruins?â€ she snarled.

â€œI wonâ€™t blow up the house,â€ said Harry, but they werenâ€™t listening.

â€œI suppose we could take him to the zoo,â€ said Aunt Petunia slowly, â€œâ€¦and leave him in the car.â€¦â€

â€œThat carâ€™s new, heâ€™s not sitting in it alone.â€¦â€

Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasnâ€™t really crying â€” it had been years since heâ€™d really cried â€” but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.

â€œDinky Duddydums, donâ€™t cry, Mummy wonâ€™t let him spoil your special day!â€ she cried, flinging her arms around him.

â€œIâ€¦donâ€™tâ€¦wantâ€¦himâ€¦t-t-to come!â€ Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. â€œHe always sp-spoils everything!â€ He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his motherâ€™s arms.

Just then, the doorbell rang â€” â€œOh, good Lord, theyâ€™re here!â€ said Aunt Petunia frantically â€” and a moment later, Dudleyâ€™s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held peopleâ€™s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.

Half an hour later, Harry, who couldnâ€™t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleysâ€™ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadnâ€™t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before theyâ€™d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.

â€œIâ€™m warning you,â€ he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harryâ€™s, â€œIâ€™m warning you now, boy â€” any funny business, anything at all â€” and youâ€™ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.â€

â€œIâ€™m not going to do anything,â€ said Harry, â€œhonestlyâ€¦â€

But Uncle Vernon didnâ€™t believe him. No one ever did.

The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didnâ€™t make them happen.

Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnâ€™t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left â€œto hide that horrible scar.â€ Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldnâ€™t explain how it had grown back so quickly.

Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudleyâ€™s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldnâ€™t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasnâ€™t punished.

On the other hand, heâ€™d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudleyâ€™s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harryâ€™s surprise as anyone elseâ€™s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harryâ€™s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all heâ€™d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.

But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnâ€™t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figgâ€™s cabbage-smelling living room.

While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.

â€œâ€¦roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,â€ he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.

â€œI had a dream about a motorcycle,â€ said Harry, remembering suddenly. â€œIt was flying.â€

Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: â€œMOTORCYCLES DONâ€™T FLY!â€

Dudley and Piers sniggered.

â€œI know they donâ€™t,â€ said Harry. â€œIt was only a dream.â€

But he wished he hadnâ€™t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnâ€™t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon â€” they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.

It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasnâ€™t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasnâ€™t blond.

Harry had the best morning heâ€™d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldnâ€™t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnâ€™t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.

Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.

After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernonâ€™s car and crushed it into a trash can â€” but at the moment it didnâ€™t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.

Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.

â€œMake it move,â€ he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didnâ€™t budge.

â€œDo it again,â€ Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.

â€œThis is boring,â€ Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.

Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldnâ€™t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself â€” no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harryâ€™s.

It winked.

Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They werenâ€™t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.

The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:

â€œI get that all the time.â€

â€œI know,â€ Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasnâ€™t sure the snake could hear him. â€œIt must be really annoying.â€

The snake nodded vigorously.

â€œWhere do you come from, anyway?â€ Harry asked.

The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.

Boa Constrictor, Brazil.

â€œWas it nice there?â€

The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. â€œOh, I see â€” so youâ€™ve never been to Brazil?â€

As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. â€œDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WONâ€™T BELIEVE WHAT ITâ€™S DOING!â€

Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.

â€œOut of the way, you,â€ he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened â€” one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.

Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictorâ€™s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.

As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, â€œBrazil, here I come.â€¦ Thanksss, amigo.â€

The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.

â€œBut the glass,â€ he kept saying, â€œwhere did the glass go?â€

The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadnâ€™t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernonâ€™s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, â€œHarry was talking to it, werenâ€™t you, Harry?â€

Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, â€œGo â€” cupboard â€” stay â€” no meals,â€ before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.



Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didnâ€™t know what time it was and he couldnâ€™t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldnâ€™t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.

Heâ€™d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since heâ€™d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldnâ€™t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldnâ€™t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldnâ€™t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.

When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.

At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudleyâ€™s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudleyâ€™s gang.

CHAPTER THREE




LETTERS FROM NO ONE



T he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.

Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudleyâ€™s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudleyâ€™s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.

This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldnâ€™t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernonâ€™s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.

â€œThey stuff peopleâ€™s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,â€ he told Harry. â€œWant to come upstairs and practice?â€

â€œNo, thanks,â€ said Harry. â€œThe poor toiletâ€™s never had anything as horrible as your head down it â€” it might be sick.â€ Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what heâ€™d said.

One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figgâ€™s. Mrs. Figg wasnâ€™t as bad as usual. It turned out sheâ€™d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didnâ€™t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though sheâ€™d had it for several years.

That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltingsâ€™ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers werenâ€™t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.

As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldnâ€™t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didnâ€™t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.

* * *

There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.

â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€ he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.

â€œYour new school uniform,â€ she said.

Harry looked in the bowl again.

â€œOh,â€ he said, â€œI didnâ€™t realize it had to be so wet.â€

â€œDonâ€™t be stupid,â€ snapped Aunt Petunia. â€œIâ€™m dyeing some of Dudleyâ€™s old things gray for you. Itâ€™ll look just like everyone elseâ€™s when Iâ€™ve finished.â€

Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High â€” like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.

Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harryâ€™s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.

They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.

â€œGet the mail, Dudley,â€ said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.

â€œMake Harry get it.â€

â€œGet the mail, Harry.â€

â€œMake Dudley get it.â€

â€œPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.â€

Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernonâ€™s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and â€” a letter for Harry.

Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives â€” he didnâ€™t belong to the library, so heâ€™d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:

Mr. H. Potter

The Cupboard under the Stairs

4 Privet Drive

Little Whinging

Surrey



The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.

Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.

â€œHurry up, boy!â€ shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. â€œWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?â€ He chuckled at his own joke.

Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.

Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.

â€œMargeâ€™s ill,â€ he informed Aunt Petunia. â€œAte a funny whelk.â€¦â€

â€œDad!â€ said Dudley suddenly. â€œDad, Harryâ€™s got something!â€

Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.

â€œThatâ€™s mine!â€ said Harry, trying to snatch it back.

â€œWhoâ€™d be writing to you?â€ sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didnâ€™t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.

â€œP-P-Petunia!â€ he gasped.

Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.

â€œVernon! Oh my goodness â€” Vernon!â€

They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasnâ€™t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.

â€œI want to read that letter,â€ he said loudly.

â€œI want to read it,â€ said Harry furiously, â€œas itâ€™s mine.â€

â€œGet out, both of you,â€ croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.

Harry didnâ€™t move.

â€œI WANT MY LETTER!â€ he shouted.

â€œLet me see it!â€ demanded Dudley.

â€œOUT!â€ roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.

â€œVernon,â€ Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, â€œlook at the address â€” how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You donâ€™t think theyâ€™re watching the house?â€

â€œWatching â€” spying â€” might be following us,â€ muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.

â€œBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we donâ€™t want â€”â€

Harry could see Uncle Vernonâ€™s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.

â€œNo,â€ he said finally. â€œNo, weâ€™ll ignore it. If they donâ€™t get an answerâ€¦Yes, thatâ€™s bestâ€¦we wonâ€™t do anythingâ€¦â€

â€œBut â€”â€

â€œIâ€™m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didnâ€™t we swear when we took him in weâ€™d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?â€



That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something heâ€™d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.

â€œWhereâ€™s my letter?â€ said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. â€œWhoâ€™s writing to me?â€

â€œNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,â€ said Uncle Vernon shortly. â€œI have burned it.â€

â€œIt was not a mistake,â€ said Harry angrily, â€œit had my cupboard on it.â€

â€œSILENCE!â€ yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.

â€œEr â€” yes, Harry â€” about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinkingâ€¦youâ€™re really getting a bit big for itâ€¦we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudleyâ€™s second bedroom.

â€œWhy?â€ said Harry.

â€œDonâ€™t ask questions!â€ snapped his uncle. â€œTake this stuff upstairs, now.â€

The Dursleysâ€™ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernonâ€™s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnâ€™t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighborâ€™s dog; in the corner was Dudleyâ€™s first-ever television set, which heâ€™d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though theyâ€™d never been touched.

From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I donâ€™t want him in thereâ€¦I need that roomâ€¦make him get out...â€

Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday heâ€™d have given anything to be up here. Today heâ€™d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.



Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. Heâ€™d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didnâ€™t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing heâ€™d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.

When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, â€œThereâ€™s another one! â€˜Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive â€”â€™â€

With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harryâ€™s letter clutched in his hand.

â€œGo to your cupboard â€” I mean, your bedroom,â€ he wheezed at Harry. â€œDudley â€” go â€” just go.â€

Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnâ€™t received his first letter. Surely that meant theyâ€™d try again? And this time heâ€™d make sure they didnâ€™t fail. He had a plan.



The repaired alarm clock rang at six oâ€™clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustnâ€™t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.

He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door â€”

â€œAAAAARRRGH!â€

Harry leapt into the air; heâ€™d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat â€” something alive!

Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncleâ€™s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didnâ€™t do exactly what heâ€™d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernonâ€™s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.

â€œI want â€”â€ he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.

Uncle Vernon didnâ€™t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.

â€œSee,â€ he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, â€œif they canâ€™t deliver them theyâ€™ll just give up.â€

â€œIâ€™m not sure thatâ€™ll work, Vernon.â€

â€œOh, these peopleâ€™s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, theyâ€™re not like you and me,â€ said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.



On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldnâ€™t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.

Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed â€œTiptoe Through the Tulipsâ€ as he worked, and jumped at small noises.



On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.

â€œWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?â€ Dudley asked Harry in amazement.

* * *

On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.

â€œNo post on Sundays,â€ he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, â€œno damn letters today â€”â€

Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one â€”

â€œOut! OUT!â€

Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.

â€œThat does it,â€ said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. â€œI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. Weâ€™re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!â€

He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.

They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didnâ€™t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.

â€œShake â€™em offâ€¦shake â€™em off,â€ he would mutter whenever he did this.

They didnâ€™t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. Heâ€™d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, heâ€™d missed five television programs heâ€™d wanted to see, and heâ€™d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.

Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.â€¦



They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.

â€œâ€™Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an â€™undred of these at the front desk.â€

She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:



Mr. H. Potter

Room 17

Railview Hotel

Cokeworth



Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.

â€œIâ€™ll take them,â€ said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.

* * *

â€œWouldnâ€™t it be better just to go home, dear?â€ Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didnâ€™t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.

â€œDaddyâ€™s gone mad, hasnâ€™t he?â€ Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.

It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.

â€œItâ€™s Monday,â€ he told his mother. â€œThe Great Humbertoâ€™s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.â€

Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday â€” and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television â€” then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harryâ€™s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun â€” last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernonâ€™s old socks. Still, you werenâ€™t eleven every day.

Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didnâ€™t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what heâ€™d bought.

â€œFound the perfect place!â€ he said. â€œCome on! Everyone out!â€

It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.

â€œStorm forecast for tonight!â€ said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. â€œAnd this gentlemanâ€™s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!â€

A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.

â€œIâ€™ve already got us some rations,â€ said Uncle Vernon, â€œso all aboard!â€

It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.

The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.

Uncle Vernonâ€™s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

â€œCould do with some of those letters now, eh?â€ he said cheerfully.

He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didnâ€™t cheer him up at all.

As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.

The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldnâ€™t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudleyâ€™s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudleyâ€™s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry heâ€™d be eleven in ten minutesâ€™ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.

Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasnâ€™t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that heâ€™d be able to steal one somehow.

Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?

One minute to go and heâ€™d be eleven. Thirty seconds...twentyâ€¦tenâ€¦nine â€” maybe heâ€™d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him â€” threeâ€¦twoâ€¦oneâ€¦

BOOM.

The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER FOUR




THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS



B OOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.

â€œWhereâ€™s the cannon?â€ he said stupidly.

There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands â€“ now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.

â€œWhoâ€™s there?â€ he shouted. â€œI warn you â€” Iâ€™m armed!â€

There was a pause. Then â€”

SMASH!

The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.

A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.

The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.

â€œCouldnâ€™t make us a cup oâ€™ tea, could yeh? Itâ€™s not been an easy journey.â€¦â€

He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.

â€œBudge up, yeh great lump,â€ said the stranger.

Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.

â€œAnâ€™ hereâ€™s Harry!â€ said the giant.

Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.

â€œLasâ€™ time I saw you, you was only a baby,â€ said the giant. â€œYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yehâ€™ve got yer momâ€™s eyes.â€

Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.

â€œI demand that you leave at once, sir!â€ he said. â€œYou are breaking and entering!â€

â€œAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,â€ said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernonâ€™s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.

Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.

â€œAnyway â€” Harry,â€ said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, â€œa very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here â€” I mighta sat on it at some point, but itâ€™ll taste all right.â€

From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.

Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, â€œWho are you?â€

The giant chuckled.

â€œTrue, I havenâ€™t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.â€

He held out an enormous hand and shook Harryâ€™s whole arm.

â€œWhat about that tea then, eh?â€ he said, rubbing his hands together. â€œIâ€™d not say no ter summat stronger if yehâ€™ve got it, mind.â€

His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldnâ€™t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though heâ€™d sunk into a hot bath.

The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, â€œDonâ€™t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.â€

The giant chuckled darkly.

â€œYer great puddinâ€™ of a son donâ€™ need fatteninâ€™ anymore, Dursley, donâ€™ worry.â€

He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldnâ€™t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, â€œIâ€™m sorry, but I still donâ€™t really know who you are.â€

The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

â€œCall me Hagrid,â€ he said, â€œeveryone does. Anâ€™ like I told yeh, Iâ€™m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts â€” yehâ€™ll know all about Hogwarts, oâ€™ course.

â€œEr â€” no,â€ said Harry.

Hagrid looked shocked.

â€œSorry,â€ Harry said quickly.

â€œSorry?â€ barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. â€œItâ€™s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh werenâ€™t gettinâ€™ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldnâ€™t even know abouâ€™ Hogwarts, fer cryinâ€™ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?â€

â€œAll what?â€ asked Harry.

â€œALL WHAT?â€ Hagrid thundered. â€œNow wait jusâ€™ one second!â€

He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.

â€œDo you mean ter tell me,â€ he growled at the Dursleys, â€œthat this boy â€” this boy! â€” knows nothinâ€™ abouâ€™ â€” about ANYTHING?â€

Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks werenâ€™t bad.

â€œI know some things,â€ he said. â€œI can, you know, do math and stuff.â€

But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, â€œAbout our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parentsâ€™ world.â€

â€œWhat world?â€

Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.

â€œDURSLEY!â€ he boomed.

Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like â€œMimblewimble.â€ Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.

â€œBut yeh must know about yer mom and dad,â€ he said. â€œI mean, theyâ€™re famous. Youâ€™re famous.â€

â€œWhat? My â€” my mom and dad werenâ€™t famous, were they?â€

â€œYeh donâ€™ know...yeh donâ€™ know....â€ Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.

â€œYeh donâ€™ know what yeh are?â€ he said finally.

Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.

â€œStop!â€ he commanded. â€œStop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!â€

A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.

â€œYou never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! Anâ€™ youâ€™ve kept it from him all these years?â€

â€œKept what from me?â€ said Harry eagerly.

â€œSTOP! I FORBID YOU!â€ yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.

Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.

â€œAh, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,â€ said Hagrid. â€œHarry â€” yer a wizard.â€

There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.

â€œIâ€™m a what?â€ gasped Harry.

â€œA wizard, oâ€™ course,â€ said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, â€œanâ€™ a thumpinâ€™ good â€˜un, Iâ€™d say, once yehâ€™ve been trained up a bit. With a mum anâ€™ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? Anâ€™ I reckon itâ€™s abouâ€™ time yeh read yer letter.â€

Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:



HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY



Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)



Dear Mr. Potter,

We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.

Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.

Yours sincerely,



Minerva McGonagall,

Deputy Headmistress



Questions exploded inside Harryâ€™s head like fireworks and he couldnâ€™t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, â€œWhat does it mean, they await my owl?â€

â€œGallopinâ€™ Gorgons, that reminds me,â€ said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl â€” a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl â€” a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:



Dear Professor Dumbledore,

Given Harry his letter.

Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.

Weatherâ€™s horrible. Hope youâ€™re well.

Hagrid



Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.

Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.

â€œWhere was I?â€ said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.

â€œHeâ€™s not going,â€ he said.

Hagrid grunted.

â€œIâ€™d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,â€ he said.

â€œA what?â€ said Harry, interested.

â€œA Muggle,â€ said Hagrid, â€œitâ€™s what we call nonmagic folk like them. Anâ€™ itâ€™s your bad luck you grew up in a family oâ€™ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.â€

â€œWe swore when we took him in weâ€™d put a stop to that rubbish,â€ said Uncle Vernon, â€œswore weâ€™d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!â€

â€œYou knew?â€ said Harry. â€œYou knew Iâ€™m a â€” a wizard?â€

â€œKnew!â€ shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. â€œKnew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that â€” that school â€” and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was â€” a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!â€

She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.

â€œThen she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew youâ€™d be just the same, just as strange, just as â€” as â€” abnormal â€” and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!â€

Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, â€œBlown up? You told me they died in a car crash!â€

â€œCAR CRASH!â€ roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. â€œHow could a car crash kill Lily anâ€™ James Potter? Itâ€™s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowinâ€™ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!â€

â€œBut why? What happened?â€ Harry asked urgently.

The anger faded from Hagridâ€™s face. He looked suddenly anxious.

â€œI never expected this,â€ he said, in a low, worried voice. â€œI had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettinâ€™ hold of yeh, how much yeh didnâ€™t know. Ah, Harry, I donâ€™ know if Iâ€™m the right person ter tell yeh â€” but someoneâ€™s gotta â€” yeh canâ€™t go off ter Hogwarts not knowinâ€™.â€

He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.

â€œWell, itâ€™s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh â€” mind, I canâ€™t tell yeh everythinâ€™, itâ€™s a great mystâ€™ry, parts of it.â€¦â€

He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, â€œIt begins, I suppose, with â€” with a person called â€” but itâ€™s incredible yeh donâ€™t know his name, everyone in our world knows â€”â€

â€œWho?â€

â€œWell â€” I donâ€™ like sayinâ€™ the name if I can help it. No one does.â€

â€œWhy not?â€

â€œGulpinâ€™ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...â€

Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.

â€œCould you write it down?â€ Harry suggested.

â€œNah â€” canâ€™t spell it. All right â€” Voldemort. â€ Hagrid shuddered. â€œDonâ€™ make me say it again. Anyway, this â€” this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookinâ€™ fer followers. Got â€˜em, too â€” some were afraid, some just wanted a bit oâ€™ his power, â€˜cause he was gettinâ€™ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didnâ€™t know who ter trust, didnâ€™t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witchesâ€¦terrible things happened. He was takinâ€™ over. â€˜Course, some stood up to him â€” anâ€™ he killed â€˜em. Horribly. One oâ€™ the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledoreâ€™s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didnâ€™t dare try takinâ€™ the school, not jusâ€™ then, anyway.

â€œNow, yer mum anâ€™ dad were as good a witch anâ€™ wizard as I ever knew. Head boy anâ€™ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the mystâ€™ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get â€˜em on his side beforeâ€¦probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythinâ€™ ter do with the Dark Side.

â€œMaybe he thought he could persuade â€˜em...maybe he just wanted â€˜em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house anâ€™ â€” anâ€™ â€”â€

Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.

â€œSorry,â€ he said. â€œBut itâ€™s that sad â€” knew yer mum anâ€™ dad, anâ€™ nicer people yeh couldnâ€™t find â€” anywayâ€¦.

â€œYou-Know-Who killed â€˜em. Anâ€™ then â€” anâ€™ this is the real mystâ€™ry of the thing â€” he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killinâ€™ by then. But he couldnâ€™t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. Thatâ€™s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh â€” took care of yer mum anâ€™ dad anâ€™ yer house, even â€” but it didnâ€™t work on you, anâ€™ thatâ€™s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill â€™em, no one except you, anâ€™ heâ€™d killed some oâ€™ the best witches anâ€™ wizards of the age â€” the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts â€” anâ€™ you was only a baby, anâ€™ you lived.â€

Something very painful was going on in Harryâ€™s mind. As Hagridâ€™s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before â€” and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.

Hagrid was watching him sadly.

â€œTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledoreâ€™s orders. Brought yeh ter this lotâ€¦.â€

â€œLoad of old tosh,â€ said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.

â€œNow, you listen here, boy,â€ he snarled, â€œI accept thereâ€™s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldnâ€™t have cured â€” and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the worldâ€™s better off without them in my opinion â€” asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types â€” just what I expected, always knew theyâ€™d come to a sticky end â€”â€

But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, â€œIâ€™m warning you, Dursley â€” Iâ€™m warning you â€” one more wordâ€¦.â€

In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernonâ€™s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.

â€œThatâ€™s better,â€ said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.

Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.

â€œBut what happened to Vol-, sorry â€” I mean, You-Know-Who?â€

â€œGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. Thatâ€™s the biggest mystâ€™ry, seeâ€¦he was gettinâ€™ more anâ€™ more powerful â€” whyâ€™d he go?

â€œSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say heâ€™s still out there, bidinâ€™ his time, like, but I donâ€™ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of â€˜em came outta kinda trances. Donâ€™ reckon they couldâ€™ve done if he was cominâ€™ back.

â€œMost of us reckon heâ€™s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. â€™Cause somethinâ€™ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethinâ€™ goinâ€™ on that night he hadnâ€™t counted on â€” I dunno what it was, no one does â€” but somethinâ€™ about you stumped him, all right.â€

Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? Heâ€™d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadnâ€™t they been turned into warty toads every time theyâ€™d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If heâ€™d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?

â€œHagrid,â€ he said quietly, â€œI think you must have made a mistake. I donâ€™t think I can be a wizard.â€

To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.

â€œNot a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?â€

Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about itâ€¦every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angryâ€¦chased by Dudleyâ€™s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reachâ€¦dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, heâ€™d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadnâ€™t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadnâ€™t he set a boa constrictor on him?

Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.

â€œSee?â€ said Hagrid. â€œHarry Potter, not a wizard â€” you wait, youâ€™ll be right famous at Hogwarts.â€

But Uncle Vernon wasnâ€™t going to give in without a fight.

â€œHavenâ€™t I told you heâ€™s not going?â€ he hissed. â€œHeâ€™s going to Stonewall High and heâ€™ll be grateful for it. Iâ€™ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish â€” spell books and wands and â€”â€

â€œIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you wonâ€™t stop him,â€ growled Hagrid. â€œStop Lily anâ€™ James Potterâ€™s son goinâ€™ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His nameâ€™s been down ever since he was born. Heâ€™s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he wonâ€™t know himself. Heâ€™ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, anâ€™ heâ€™ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbledâ€”â€

â€œI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!â€ yelled Uncle Vernon.

But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, â€œNEVER â€”â€ he thundered, â€œâ€” INSULT â€” ALBUS â€” DUMBLEDORE â€” IN â€” FRONT â€” OF â€” ME!â€

He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley â€” there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pigâ€™s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.

Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.

Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.

â€œShouldnâ€™ta lost me temper,â€ he said ruefully, â€œbut it didnâ€™t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnâ€™t much left ter do.â€

He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.

â€œBe grateful if yeh didnâ€™t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m â€” er â€” not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakinâ€™. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh anâ€™ get yer letters to yeh anâ€™ stuff â€” one oâ€™ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.â€

â€œWhy arenâ€™t you supposed to do magic?â€ asked Harry.

â€œOh, well â€” I was at Hogwarts meself but I â€” er â€” got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half anâ€™ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.â€

â€œWhy were you expelled?â€

â€œItâ€™s gettinâ€™ late and weâ€™ve got lots ter do tomorrow,â€ said Hagrid loudly. â€œGotta get up ter town, get all yer books anâ€™ that.â€

He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.

â€œYou can kip under that,â€ he said. â€œDonâ€™ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple oâ€™ doormice in one oâ€™ the pockets.â€

CHAPTER FIVE




DIAGON ALLEY



H arry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.

â€œIt was a dream, he told himself firmly. â€œI dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes Iâ€™ll be at home in my cupboard.â€

There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.

And thereâ€™s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didnâ€™t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

â€œAll right,â€ Harry mumbled, â€œIâ€™m getting up.â€

He sat up and Hagridâ€™s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.

Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didnâ€™t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagridâ€™s coat.

â€œDonâ€™t do that.â€

Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.

â€œHagrid!â€ said Harry loudly. â€œThereâ€™s an owl â€”â€

â€œPay him,â€ Hagrid grunted into the sofa.

â€œWhat?â€

â€œHe wants payinâ€™ fer deliverinâ€™ the paper. Look in the pockets.â€

Hagridâ€™s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets â€” bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.

â€œGive him five Knuts,â€ said Hagrid sleepily.

â€œKnuts?â€

â€œThe little bronze ones.â€

Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.

Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.

â€œBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London anâ€™ buy all yer stuff fer school.â€

Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.

â€œUm â€” Hagrid?â€

â€œMm?â€ said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.

â€œI havenâ€™t got any money â€” and you heard Uncle Vernon last nightâ€¦he wonâ€™t pay for me to go and learn magic.â€

â€œDonâ€™t worry about that,â€ said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. â€œDâ€™yeh think yer parents didnâ€™t leave yeh anything?â€

â€œBut if their house was destroyed â€”â€

â€œThey didnâ€™ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizardsâ€™ bank. Have a sausage, theyâ€™re not bad cold â€” anâ€™ I wouldnâ€™ say no teh a bit oâ€™ yer birthday cake, neither.â€

â€œWizards have banks?â€

â€œJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.â€

Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.

â€œGoblins?â€

â€œYeah â€” so yehâ€™d be mad ter try anâ€™ rob it, Iâ€™ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe â€” â€˜cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter oâ€™ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.â€ Hagrid drew himself up proudly. â€œHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchinâ€™ you â€” gettinâ€™ things from Gringotts â€” knows he can trust me, see.â€

â€œGot everythinâ€™? Come on, then.â€

Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.

â€œHow did you get here?â€ Harry asked, looking around for another boat.

â€œFlew,â€ said Hagrid.

â€œFlew?â€

â€œYeah â€” but weâ€™ll go back in this. Not sâ€™pposed ter use magic now Iâ€™ve got yeh.â€

They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.

â€œSeems a shame ter row, though,â€ said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. â€œIf I was ter â€” er â€” speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentioninâ€™ it at Hogwarts?â€

â€œOf course not,â€ said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.

â€œWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?â€ Harry asked.

â€œSpells â€” enchantments,â€ said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. â€œThey say thereâ€™s dragons guardinâ€™ the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way â€” Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yehâ€™d die of hunger tryinâ€™ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.â€

Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, heâ€™d never had so many questions in his life.

â€œMinistry oâ€™ Magic messinâ€™ things up as usual,â€ Hagrid muttered, turning the page.

â€œThereâ€™s a Ministry of Magic?â€ Harry asked, before he could stop himself.

â€œâ€™Course,â€ said Hagrid. â€œThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, oâ€™ course, but heâ€™d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askinâ€™ fer advice.â€

â€œBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?â€

â€œWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that thereâ€™s still witches anâ€™ wizards up anâ€™ down the country.â€

â€œWhy?â€

â€œWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyoneâ€™d be wantinâ€™ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, weâ€™re best left alone.â€

At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.

Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldnâ€™t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, â€œSee that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?â€

â€œHagrid,â€ said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, â€œdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?â€

â€œWell, so they say,â€ said Hagrid. â€œCrikey, Iâ€™d like a dragon.â€

â€œYouâ€™d like one?â€

â€œWanted one ever since I was a kid â€” here we go.â€

They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutesâ€™ time. Hagrid, who didnâ€™t understand â€œMuggle money,â€ as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.

People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.

â€œStill got yer letter, Harry?â€ he asked as he counted stitches.

Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.

â€œGood,â€ said Hagrid. â€œThereâ€™s a list there of everything yeh need.â€

Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnâ€™t noticed the night before, and read:

â€œCan we buy all this in London?â€ Harry wondered aloud.

â€œIf yeh know where to go,â€ said Hagrid.



Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.

â€œI donâ€™t know how the Muggles manage without magic,â€ he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.

Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadnâ€™t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldnâ€™t help trusting him.

â€œThis is it,â€ said Hagrid, coming to a halt, â€œthe Leaky Cauldron. Itâ€™s a famous place.â€

It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadnâ€™t pointed it out, Harry wouldnâ€™t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didnâ€™t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnâ€™t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.

For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, â€œThe usual, Hagrid?â€

â€œCanâ€™t, Tom, Iâ€™m on Hogwarts business,â€ said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harryâ€™s shoulder and making Harryâ€™s knees buckle.

â€œGood Lord,â€ said the bartender, peering at Harry, â€œis this â€” can this be â€”?â€

The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.

â€œBless my soul,â€ whispered the old bartender, â€œHarry Potterâ€¦what an honor.â€

He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.

â€œWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.â€

Harry didnâ€™t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.

Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.

â€œDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m meeting you at last.â€

â€œSo proud, Mr. Potter, Iâ€™m just so proud.â€

â€œAlways wanted to shake your hand â€” Iâ€™m all of a flutter.â€

â€œDelighted, Mr. Potter, just canâ€™t tell you, Diggleâ€™s the name, Dedalus Diggle.â€

â€œIâ€™ve seen you before!â€ said Harry, as Dedalus Diggleâ€™s top hat fell off in his excitement. â€œYou bowed to me once in a shop.â€

â€œHe remembers!â€ cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. â€œDid you hear that? He remembers me!â€ Harry shook hands again and again â€” Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.

A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.

â€œProfessor Quirrell!â€ said Hagrid. â€œHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.â€

â€œP-P-Potter,â€ stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harryâ€™s hand, â€œc-canâ€™t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.â€

â€œWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?â€

â€œD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,â€ muttered Professor Quirrell, as though heâ€™d rather not think about it. â€œN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?â€ He laughed nervously. â€œYouâ€™ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? Iâ€™ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.â€ He looked terrified at the very thought.

But the others wouldnâ€™t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.

â€œMust get on â€” lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.â€

Doris Crockford shook Harryâ€™s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.

Hagrid grinned at Harry.

â€œTold yeh, didnâ€™t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblinâ€™ ter meet yeh â€” mind you, heâ€™s usually tremblinâ€™.â€

â€œIs he always that nervous?â€

â€œOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyinâ€™ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit oâ€™ trouble with a hag â€” never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject â€” now, whereâ€™s me umbrella?â€

Vampires? Hags? Harryâ€™s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.

â€œThree upâ€¦two acrossâ€¦â€ he muttered. â€œRight, stand back, Harry.â€

He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.

The brick he had touched quivered â€” it wriggled â€” in the middle, a small hole appeared â€” it grew wider and wider â€” a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.

â€œWelcome,â€ said Hagrid, â€œto Diagon Alley.â€

He grinned at Harryâ€™s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.

The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons â€” All Sizes â€” Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver â€” Self-Stirring â€” Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.

â€œYeah, youâ€™ll be needinâ€™ one,â€ said Hagrid, â€œbut we gotta get yer money first.â€

Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, â€œDragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, theyâ€™re mad.â€¦â€

A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium â€” Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harryâ€™s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. â€œLook,â€ Harry heard one of them say, â€œthe new Nimbus Two Thousand â€” fastest ever â€”â€ There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eelsâ€™ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.â€¦

â€œGringotts,â€ said Hagrid.

They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was â€”

â€œYeah, thatâ€™s a goblin,â€ said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:

Enter, stranger, but take heed

Of what awaits the sin of greed,

For those who take, but do not earn,

Must pay most dearly in their turn.

So if you seek beneath our floors

A treasure that was never yours,

Thief, you have been warned, beware

Of finding more than treasure there.



â€œLike I said, Yehâ€™d be mad ter try anâ€™ rob it,â€ said Hagrid.

A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.

â€œMorning,â€ said Hagrid to a free goblin. â€œWeâ€™ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potterâ€™s safe.â€

â€œYou have his key, sir?â€

â€œGot it here somewhere,â€ said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblinâ€™s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.

â€œGot it,â€ said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.

The goblin looked at it closely.

â€œThat seems to be in order.â€

â€œAnâ€™ Iâ€™ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,â€ said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. â€œItâ€™s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.â€

The goblin read the letter carefully.

â€œVery well,â€ he said, handing it back to Hagrid, â€œI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!â€

Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.

â€œWhatâ€™s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?â€ Harry asked.

â€œCanâ€™t tell yeh that,â€ said Hagrid mysteriously. â€œVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledoreâ€™s trusted me. Moreâ€™n my jobâ€™s worth ter tell yeh that.â€

Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in â€” Hagrid with some difficulty â€” and were off.

At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasnâ€™t steering.

Harryâ€™s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late â€” they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.

â€œI never know,â€ Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, â€œwhatâ€™s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?â€

â€œStalagmiteâ€™s got an â€˜mâ€™ in it,â€ said Hagrid. â€œAnâ€™ donâ€™ ask me questions just now, I think Iâ€™m gonna be sick.â€

He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.

Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.

â€œAll yours,â€ smiled Hagrid.

All Harryâ€™s â€” it was incredible. The Dursleys couldnâ€™t have known about this or theyâ€™d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.

Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.

â€œThe gold ones are Galleons,â€ he explained. â€œSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, itâ€™s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple oâ€™ terms, weâ€™ll keep the rest safe for yeh.â€ He turned to Griphook. â€œVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?â€

â€œOne speed only,â€ said Griphook.

They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.

Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.

â€œStand back,â€ said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.

â€œIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, theyâ€™d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,â€ said Griphook.

â€œHow often do you check to see if anyoneâ€™s inside?â€ Harry asked.

â€œAbout once every ten years,â€ said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.

Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least â€” but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.

â€œCome on, back in this infernal cart, and donâ€™t talk to me on the way back, itâ€™s best if I keep me mouth shut,â€ said Hagrid.



One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didnâ€™t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didnâ€™t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than heâ€™d had in his whole life â€” more money than even Dudley had ever had.

â€œMight as well get yer uniform,â€ said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkinâ€™s Robes for All Occasions. â€œListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.â€ He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkinâ€™s shop alone, feeling nervous.

Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.

â€œHogwarts, dear?â€ she said, when Harry started to speak. â€œGot the lot here â€” another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.â€

In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.

â€œHello,â€ said the boy, â€œHogwarts, too?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Harry.

â€œMy fatherâ€™s next door buying my books and motherâ€™s up the street looking at wands,â€ said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. â€œThen Iâ€™m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I donâ€™t see why first years canâ€™t have their own. I think Iâ€™ll bully father into getting me one and Iâ€™ll smuggle it in somehow.â€

Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.

â€œHave you got your own broom?â€ the boy went on.

â€œNo,â€ said Harry.

â€œPlay Quidditch at all?â€

â€œNo,â€ Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.

â€œI do â€” Father says itâ€™s a crime if Iâ€™m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house youâ€™ll be in yet?â€

â€œNo,â€ said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.

â€œWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know Iâ€™ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been â€” imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think Iâ€™d leave, wouldnâ€™t you?â€

â€œMmm,â€ said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.

â€œI say, look at that man!â€ said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnâ€™t come in.

â€œThatâ€™s Hagrid,â€ said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didnâ€™t. â€œHe works at Hogwarts.â€

â€œOh,â€ said the boy, â€œIâ€™ve heard of him. Heâ€™s a sort of servant, isnâ€™t he?â€

â€œHeâ€™s the gamekeeper,â€ said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.

â€œYes, exactly. I heard heâ€™s a sort of savage â€” lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.â€

â€œI think heâ€™s brilliant,â€ said Harry coldly.

â€œDo you?â€ said the boy, with a slight sneer. â€œWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?â€

â€œTheyâ€™re dead,â€ said Harry shortly. He didnâ€™t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.

â€œOh, sorry,â€ said the other, not sounding sorry at all. â€œBut they were our kind, werenâ€™t they?â€

â€œThey were a witch and wizard, if thatâ€™s what you mean.â€

â€œI really donâ€™t think they should let the other sort in, do you? Theyâ€™re just not the same, theyâ€™ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. Whatâ€™s your surname, anyway?â€

But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, â€œThatâ€™s you done, my dear,â€ and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.

â€œWell, Iâ€™ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,â€ said the drawling boy.

Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).

â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€ said Hagrid.

â€œNothing,â€ Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, â€œHagrid, whatâ€™s Quidditch?â€

â€œBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettinâ€™ how little yeh know â€” not knowinâ€™ about Quidditch!â€

â€œDonâ€™t make me feel worse,â€ said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkinâ€™s.

â€œâ€” and he said people from Muggle families shouldnâ€™t even be allowed in â€”â€

â€œYer not from a Muggle family. If heâ€™d known who yeh were â€” heâ€™s grown up knowinâ€™ yer name if his parents are wizardinâ€™ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some oâ€™ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in â€˜em in a long line oâ€™ Muggles â€” look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!â€

â€œSo what is Quidditch?â€

â€œItâ€™s our sport. Wizard sport. Itâ€™s like â€” like soccer in the Muggle world â€” everyone follows Quidditch â€” played up in the air on broomsticks and thereâ€™s four balls â€” sorta hard ter explain the rules.â€

â€œAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?â€

â€œSchool houses. Thereâ€™s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot oâ€™ duffers, but â€”â€

â€œI bet Iâ€™m in Hufflepuff,â€ said Harry gloomily.

â€œBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,â€ said Hagrid darkly. â€œThereâ€™s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnâ€™t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.â€

â€œVol-, sorry â€”You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?â€

â€œYears anâ€™ years ago,â€ said Hagrid.

They bought Harryâ€™s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.

â€œI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.â€

â€œIâ€™m not sayinâ€™ thatâ€™s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,â€ said Hagrid. â€œAnâ€™ anyway, yeh couldnâ€™ work any of them curses yet, yehâ€™ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.â€

Hagrid wouldnâ€™t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (â€œIt says pewter on yer listâ€), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harryâ€™s list again.

â€œJust yer wand left â€” A yeah, anâ€™ I still havenâ€™t got yeh a birthday present.â€

Harry felt himself go red.

â€œYou donâ€™t have to â€”â€

â€œI know I donâ€™t have to. Tell yeh what, Iâ€™ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yehâ€™d be laughed at â€” anâ€™ I donâ€™ like cats, they make me sneeze. Iâ€™ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, theyâ€™re dead useful, carry yer mail anâ€™ everythinâ€™.â€

Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldnâ€™t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.

â€œDonâ€™ mention it,â€ said Hagrid gruffly. â€œDonâ€™ expect youâ€™ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now â€” only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.â€

A magic wandâ€¦this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.

The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.

A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.

â€œGood afternoon,â€ said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.

An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.

â€œHello,â€ said Harry awkwardly.

â€œAh yes,â€ said the man. â€œYes, yes. I thought Iâ€™d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.â€ It wasnâ€™t a question. â€œYou have your motherâ€™s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.â€

Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.

â€œYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it â€” itâ€™s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.â€

Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.

â€œAnd thatâ€™s whereâ€¦â€

Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harryâ€™s forehead with a long, white finger.

â€œIâ€™m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,â€ he said softly. â€œThirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong handsâ€¦well, if Iâ€™d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.â€¦â€

He shook his head and then, to Harryâ€™s relief, spotted Hagrid.

â€œRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.â€¦Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasnâ€™t it?â€

â€œIt was, sir, yes,â€ said Hagrid.

â€œGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?â€ said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.

â€œEr â€” yes, they did, yes,â€ said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. â€œIâ€™ve still got the pieces, though,â€ he added brightly.

â€œBut you donâ€™t use them?â€ said Mr. Ollivander sharply.

â€œOh, no, sir,â€ said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.

â€œHmmm,â€ said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. â€œWell, now â€” Mr. Potter. Let me see.â€ He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. â€œWhich is your wand arm?â€

â€œEr â€” well, Iâ€™m right-handed,â€ said Harry.

â€œHold out your arm. Thatâ€™s it.â€ He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, â€œEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizardâ€™s wand.â€

Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.

â€œThat will do,â€ he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. â€œRight then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.â€

Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.

â€œMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try â€”â€

Harry tried â€” but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.

â€œNo, no â€” here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.â€

Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.

â€œTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, weâ€™ll find the perfect match here somewhere â€” I wonder, now â€” yes, why not â€” unusual combination â€” holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.â€

Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, â€œOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, wellâ€¦how curiousâ€¦how very curiousâ€¦â€

He put Harryâ€™s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, â€œCuriousâ€¦curiousâ€¦

â€œSorry,â€ said Harry, â€œbut whatâ€™s curious?â€

Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.

â€œI remember every wand Iâ€™ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather â€” just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother â€” why, its brother gave you that scar.â€

Harry swallowed.

â€œYes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, rememberâ€¦I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potterâ€¦.After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things â€” terrible, yes, but great.â€

Harry shivered. He wasnâ€™t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.



The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didnâ€™t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didnâ€™t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harryâ€™s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.

â€œGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,â€ he said.

He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.

â€œYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,â€ said Hagrid.

Harry wasnâ€™t sure he could explain. Heâ€™d just had the best birthday of his life â€” and yet â€” he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.

â€œEveryone thinks Iâ€™m special,â€ he said at last. â€œAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivanderâ€¦but I donâ€™t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? Iâ€™m famous and I canâ€™t even remember what Iâ€™m famous for. I donâ€™t know what happened when Vol-, sorry â€” I mean, the night my parents died.â€

Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.

â€œDonâ€™ you worry, Harry. Youâ€™ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, youâ€™ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know itâ€™s hard. Yehâ€™ve been singled out, anâ€™ thatâ€™s always hard. But yehâ€™ll have a great time at Hogwarts â€” I did â€” still do, â€™smatter of fact.â€

Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.

â€œYer ticket fer Hogwarts, â€œ he said. â€œFirst oâ€™ September â€” Kingâ€™s Cross â€” itâ€™s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, sheâ€™ll know where to find meâ€¦.See yeh soon, Harry.â€

The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER SIX




THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS



H arryâ€™s last month with the Dursleys wasnâ€™t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldnâ€™t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didnâ€™t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him â€” in fact, they didnâ€™t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.

Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didnâ€™t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.

On the last day of August he thought heâ€™d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to Kingâ€™s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.

â€œEr â€” Uncle Vernon?â€

Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.

â€œEr â€” I need to be at Kingâ€™s Cross tomorrow to â€” to go to Hogwarts.â€

Uncle Vernon grunted again.

â€œWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?â€

Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.

â€œThank you.â€

He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.

â€œFunny way to get to a wizardsâ€™ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?â€

Harry didnâ€™t say anything.

â€œWhere is this school, anyway?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.

â€œI just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven oâ€™clock,â€ he read.

His aunt and uncle stared.

â€œPlatform what?â€

â€œNine and three-quarters.â€

â€œDonâ€™t talk rubbish,â€ said Uncle Vernon. â€œThere is no platform nine and three-quarters.â€

â€œItâ€™s on my ticket.â€

â€œBarking,â€ said Uncle Vernon, â€œhowling mad, the lot of them. Youâ€™ll see. You just wait. All right, weâ€™ll take you to Kingâ€™s Cross. Weâ€™re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldnâ€™t bother.â€

â€œWhy are you going to London?â€ Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.

â€œTaking Dudley to the hospital,â€ growled Uncle Vernon. â€œGot to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.â€



Harry woke at five oâ€™clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnâ€™t want to walk into the station in his wizardâ€™s robes â€” heâ€™d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harryâ€™s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleysâ€™ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.

They reached Kingâ€™s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harryâ€™s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.

â€œWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine â€” platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they donâ€™t seem to have built it yet, do they?â€

He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.

â€œHave a good term,â€ said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harryâ€™s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. Heâ€™d have to ask someone.

He stopped a passing guard, but didnâ€™t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldnâ€™t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven oâ€™clock, but the guard said there wasnâ€™t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.

Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectorâ€™s stand between platforms nine and ten.

At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.

â€œâ€” packed with Muggles, of course â€”â€

Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harryâ€™s in front of him â€” and they had an owl.

Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.

â€œNow, whatâ€™s the platform number?â€ said the boysâ€™ mother.

â€œNine and three-quarters!â€ piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, â€œMom, canâ€™t I goâ€¦â€

â€œYouâ€™re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.â€

What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it â€” but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.

â€œFred, you next,â€ the plump woman said.

â€œIâ€™m not Fred, Iâ€™m George,â€ said the boy. â€œHonestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Canâ€™t you tell Iâ€™m George?â€

â€œSorry, George, dear.â€

â€œOnly joking, I am Fred,â€ said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone â€” but how had he done it?

Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there â€” and then, quite suddenly, he wasnâ€™t anywhere.

There was nothing else for it.

â€œExcuse me,â€ Harry said to the plump woman.

â€œHello, dear,â€ she said. â€œFirst time at Hogwarts? Ronâ€™s new, too.â€

She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.

â€œYes,â€ said Harry. â€œThe thing is â€” the thing is, I donâ€™t know how to â€”â€

â€œHow to get onto the platform?â€ she said kindly, and Harry nodded.

â€œNot to worry,â€ she said. â€œAll you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Donâ€™t stop and donâ€™t be scared youâ€™ll crash into it, thatâ€™s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if youâ€™re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.â€

â€œEr â€” okay,â€ said Harry.

He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.

He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then heâ€™d be in trouble â€” leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run â€” the barrier was coming nearer and nearer â€” he wouldnâ€™t be able to stop â€” the cart was out of control â€” he was a foot away â€” he closed his eyes ready for the crash â€”

It didnâ€™t comeâ€¦he kept on runningâ€¦he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwartsâ€™ Express, eleven oâ€™clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.

Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.

The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, â€œGran, Iâ€™ve lost my toad again.â€

â€œOh, Neville,â€ he heard the old woman sigh.

A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.

â€œGive us a look, Lee, go on.â€

The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.

Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.

â€œWant a hand?â€ It was one of the red-haired twins heâ€™d followed through the barrier.

â€œYes, please,â€ Harry panted.

â€œOy, Fred! Câ€™mere and help!â€

With the twinsâ€™ help, Harryâ€™s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.

â€œThanks,â€ said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.

â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harryâ€™s lightning scar.

â€œBlimey,â€ said the other twin. â€œAre you â€”?â€

â€œHe is,â€ said the first twin. â€œArenâ€™t you?â€ he added to Harry.

â€œWhat?â€ said Harry.

â€œHarry Potter.â€ chorused the twins.

â€œOh, him,â€ said Harry. â€œI mean, yes, I am.â€

The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the trainâ€™s open door.

â€œFred? George? Are you there?â€

â€œComing, Mom.â€

With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.

Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.

â€œRon, youâ€™ve got something on your nose.â€

The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.

â€œMom â€” geroffâ€ He wriggled free.

â€œAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?â€ said one of the twins.

â€œShut up,â€ said Ron.

â€œWhereâ€™s Percy?â€ said their mother.

â€œHeâ€™s coming now.â€

The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.

â€œCanâ€™t stay long, Mother,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves â€”â€

â€œOh, are you a prefect, Percy?â€ said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. â€œYou should have said something, we had no idea.â€

â€œHang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,â€ said the other twin. â€œOnce â€”â€

â€œOr twice â€”â€

â€œA minute â€”â€

â€œAll summer â€”â€

â€œOh, shut up,â€ said Percy the Prefect.

â€œHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?â€ said one of the twins.

â€œBecause heâ€™s a prefect,â€ said their mother fondly. â€œAll right, dear, well, have a good term â€” send me an owl when you get there.â€

She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.

â€œNow, you two â€” this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me youâ€™ve â€” youâ€™ve blown up a toilet or â€”â€

â€œBlown up a toilet? Weâ€™ve never blown up a toilet.â€

â€œGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.â€

â€œItâ€™s not funny. And look after Ron.â€

â€œDonâ€™t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.â€

â€œShut up,â€ said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.

â€œHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?â€

Harry leaned back quickly so they couldnâ€™t see him looking.

â€œYou know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?â€

â€œWho?â€

â€œHarry Potter!â€

Harry heard the little girlâ€™s voice.

â€œOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....â€

â€œYouâ€™ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isnâ€™t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?â€

â€œAsked him. Saw his scar. Itâ€™s really there â€” like lightning.â€

â€œPoor dear â€” no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.â€

â€œNever mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?â€

Their mother suddenly became very stern.

â€œI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, donâ€™t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.â€

â€œAll right, keep your hair on.â€

A whistle sounded.

â€œHurry up!â€ their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.

â€œDonâ€™t, Ginny, weâ€™ll send you loads of owls.â€

â€œWeâ€™ll send you a Hogwartsâ€™ toilet seat.â€

â€œGeorge!â€

â€œOnly joking, Mom.â€

The train began to move. Harry saw the boysâ€™ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.

Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didnâ€™t know what he was going to â€” but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.

The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.

â€œAnyone sitting there?â€ he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. â€œEverywhere else is full.â€

Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadnâ€™t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.

â€œHey, Ron.â€

The twins were back.

â€œListen, weâ€™re going down the middle of the train â€” Lee Jordanâ€™s got a giant tarantula down there.â€

â€œRight,â€ mumbled Ron.

â€œHarry,â€ said the other twin, â€œdid we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.â€

â€œBye,â€ said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.

â€œAre you really Harry Potter?â€ Ron blurted out.

Harry nodded.

â€œOh â€” well, I thought it might be one of Fred and Georgeâ€™s jokes,â€ said Ron. â€œAnd have you really got â€” you knowâ€¦â€

He pointed at Harryâ€™s forehead.

Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.

â€œSo thatâ€™s where You-Know-Who â€”?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Harry, â€œbut I canâ€™t remember it.â€

â€œNothing?â€ said Ron eagerly.

â€œWell â€” I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.â€

â€œWow,â€ said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.

â€œAre all your family wizards?â€ asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.

â€œEr â€” Yes, I think so,â€ said Ron. â€œI think Momâ€™s got a second cousin whoâ€™s an accountant, but we never talk about him.â€

â€œSo you must know loads of magic already.â€

The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.

â€œI heard you went to live with Muggles,â€ said Ron. â€œWhat are they like?â€

â€œHorrible â€” well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish Iâ€™d had three wizard brothers.â€

â€œFive,â€ said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. â€œIâ€™m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say Iâ€™ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left â€” Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percyâ€™s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks theyâ€™re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, itâ€™s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. Iâ€™ve got Billâ€™s old robes, Charlieâ€™s old wand, and Percyâ€™s old rat.â€

Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.

â€œHis nameâ€™s Scabbers and heâ€™s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldnâ€™t aff â€” I mean, I got Scabbers instead.â€

Ronâ€™s ears went pink. He seemed to think heâ€™d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.

Harry didnâ€™t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, heâ€™d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudleyâ€™s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.

â€œâ€¦and until Hagrid told me, I didnâ€™t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort â€”â€

Ron gasped.

â€œWhat?â€ said Harry.

â€œYou said You-Know-Whoâ€™s name!â€ said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. â€œIâ€™d have thought you, of all people â€”â€

â€œIâ€™m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,â€ said Harry, â€œI just never knew you shouldnâ€™t. See what I mean? Iâ€™ve got loads to learn.â€¦I bet,â€ he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, â€œI bet Iâ€™m the worst in the class.â€

â€œYou wonâ€™t be. Thereâ€™s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.â€

While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.

Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, â€œAnything off the cart, dears?â€

Harry, who hadnâ€™t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ronâ€™s ears went pink again and he muttered that heâ€™d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.

He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry â€” but the woman didnâ€™t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bottâ€™s Every Flavor Beans, Droobleâ€™s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.

Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.

â€œHungry, are you?â€

â€œStarving,â€ said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.

Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, â€œShe always forgets I donâ€™t like corned beef..â€

â€œSwap you for one of these,â€ said Harry, holding up a pasty. â€œGo on â€”â€

â€œYou donâ€™t want this, itâ€™s all dry,â€ said Ron. â€œShe hasnâ€™t got much time,â€ he added quickly, â€œyou know, with five of us.â€

â€œGo on, have a pasty,â€ said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harryâ€™s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).

â€œWhat are these?â€ Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. â€œTheyâ€™re not really frogs, are they?â€ He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.

â€œNo,â€ said Ron. â€œBut see what the card is. Iâ€™m missing Agrippa.â€

â€œWhat?â€

â€œOh, of course, you wouldnâ€™t know â€” Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect â€” famous witches and wizards. Iâ€™ve got about five hundred, but I havenâ€™t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.â€

Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a manâ€™s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.

â€œSo this is Dumbledore!â€ said Harry.

â€œDonâ€™t tell me youâ€™d never heard of Dumbledore!â€ said Ron. â€œCan I have a frog? I might get Agrippa â€” thanks â€”â€

Harry turned over his card and read:



ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS



C onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragonâ€™s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.



Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledoreâ€™s face had disappeared.

â€œHeâ€™s gone!â€

â€œWell, you canâ€™t expect him to hang around all day,â€ said Ron. â€œHeâ€™ll be back. No, Iâ€™ve got Morgana again and Iâ€™ve got about six of herâ€¦do you want it? You can start collecting.â€

Ronâ€™s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.

â€œHelp yourself,â€ said Harry. â€œBut in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.â€

â€œDo they? What, they donâ€™t move at all?â€ Ron sounded amazed. â€œWeird!â€

Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldnâ€™t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bottâ€™s Every Flavor Beans.

â€œYou want to be careful with those,â€ Ron warned Harry. â€œWhen they say every flavor, they mean every flavor â€” you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.â€

Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.

â€œBleaaargh â€” see? Sprouts.â€

They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldnâ€™t touch, which turned out to be pepper.

The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.

There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful.

â€œSorry,â€ he said, â€œbut have you seen a toad at all?â€

When they shook their heads, he wailed, â€œIâ€™ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!â€

â€œHeâ€™ll turn up,â€ said Harry.

â€œYes,â€ said the boy miserably. â€œWell, if you see himâ€¦â€

He left.

â€œDonâ€™t know why heâ€™s so bothered,â€ said Ron. â€œIf Iâ€™d brought a toad Iâ€™d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I canâ€™t talk.â€

The rat was still snoozing on Ronâ€™s lap.

â€œHe might have died and you wouldnâ€™t know the difference,â€ said Ron in disgust. â€œI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didnâ€™t work. Iâ€™ll show you, lookâ€¦â€

He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.

â€œUnicorn hairâ€™s nearly poking out. Anyway â€”â€

He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.

â€œHas anyone seen a toad? Nevilleâ€™s lost one,â€ she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.

â€œWeâ€™ve already told him we havenâ€™t seen it,â€ said Ron, but the girl wasnâ€™t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.

â€œOh, are you doing magic? Letâ€™s see it, then.â€

She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.

â€œEr â€” all right.â€

He cleared his throat.



â€œSunshine, daisies, butter mellow,

Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.â€



He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.

â€œAre you sure thatâ€™s a real spell?â€ said the girl. â€œWell, itâ€™s not very good, is it? Iâ€™ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and itâ€™s all worked for me. Nobody in my familyâ€™s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, itâ€™s the very best school of witchcraft there is, Iâ€™ve heard â€” Iâ€™ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough â€” Iâ€™m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?â€

She said all this very fast.

Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnâ€™t learned all the course books by heart either.

â€œIâ€™m Ron Weasley,â€ Ron muttered.

â€œHarry Potter,â€ said Harry.

â€œAre you really?â€ said Hermione. â€œI know all about you, of course â€” I got a few extra books, for background reading, and youâ€™re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.â€

â€œAm I?â€ said Harry, feeling dazed.

â€œGoodness, didnâ€™t you know, Iâ€™d have found out everything I could if it was me,â€ said Hermione. â€œDo either of you know what house youâ€™ll be in? Iâ€™ve been asking around, and I hope Iâ€™m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldnâ€™t be too bad....Anyway, weâ€™d better go and look for Nevilleâ€™s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect weâ€™ll be there soon.â€

And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.

â€œWhatever house Iâ€™m in, I hope sheâ€™s not in it,â€ said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. â€œStupid spell â€” George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.â€

â€œWhat house are your brothers in?â€ asked Harry.

â€œGryffindor,â€ said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. â€œMom and Dad were in it, too. I donâ€™t know what theyâ€™ll say if Iâ€™m not. I donâ€™t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.â€

â€œThatâ€™s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?â€

â€œYeah,â€ said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.

â€œYou know, I think the ends of Scabbersâ€™ whiskers are a bit lighter,â€ said Harry, trying to take Ronâ€™s mind off houses. â€œSo what do your oldest brothers do now that theyâ€™ve left, anyway?â€

Harry was wondering what a wizard did once heâ€™d finished school.

â€œCharlieâ€™s in Romania studying dragons, and Billâ€™s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,â€ said Ron. â€œDid you hear about Gringotts? Itâ€™s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I donâ€™t suppose you get that with the Muggles â€” someone tried to rob a high security vault.â€

Harry stared.

â€œReally? What happened to them?â€

â€œNothing, thatâ€™s why itâ€™s such big news. They havenâ€™t been caught. My dad says it mustâ€™ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they donâ€™t think they took anything, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s odd. â€™Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Whoâ€™s behind it.â€

Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying â€œVoldemortâ€ without worrying.

â€œWhatâ€™s your Quidditch team?â€ Ron asked.

â€œEr â€” I donâ€™t know any.â€ Harry confessed.

â€œWhat!â€ Ron looked dumbfounded. â€œOh, you wait, itâ€™s the best game in the world â€”â€ And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games heâ€™d been to with his brothers and the broomstick heâ€™d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasnâ€™t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.

Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkinâ€™s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than heâ€™d shown back in Diagon Alley.

â€œIs it true?â€ he said. â€œTheyâ€™re saying all down the train that Harry Potterâ€™s in this compartment. So itâ€™s you, is it?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.

â€œOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,â€ said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. â€œAnd my nameâ€™s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.â€

Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.

â€œThink my nameâ€™s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.â€

He turned back to Harry. â€œYouâ€™ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You donâ€™t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.â€

He held out his hand to shake Harryâ€™s, but Harry didnâ€™t take it.

â€œI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,â€ he said coolly.

Draco Malfoy didnâ€™t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.

â€œIâ€™d be careful if I were you, Potter,â€ he said slowly. â€œUnless youâ€™re a bit politer youâ€™ll go the same way as your parents. They didnâ€™t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and itâ€™ll rub off on you.â€

Both Harry and Ron stood up.

â€œSay that again,â€ Ron said, his face as red as his hair.

â€œOh, youâ€™re going to fight us, are you?â€ Malfoy sneered.

â€œUnless you get out now,â€ said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.

â€œBut we donâ€™t feet like leaving, do we, boys? Weâ€™ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.â€

Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron â€” Ron leapt forward, but before heâ€™d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.

Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyleâ€™s knuckle â€” Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps theyâ€™d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.

â€œWhat has been going on?â€ she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.

â€œI think heâ€™s been knocked out,â€ Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. â€œNo â€” I donâ€™t believe it â€” heâ€™s gone back to sleep.â€

And so he had.

â€œYouâ€™ve met Malfoy before?â€

Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.

â€œIâ€™ve heard of his family,â€ said Ron darkly. â€œThey were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said theyâ€™d been bewitched. My dad doesnâ€™t believe it. He says Malfoyâ€™s father didnâ€™t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.â€ He turned to Hermione. â€œCan we help you with something?â€

â€œYouâ€™d better hurry up and put your robes on, Iâ€™ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says weâ€™re nearly there. You havenâ€™t been fighting, have you? Youâ€™ll be in trouble before we even get there!â€

â€œScabbers has been fighting, not us,â€ said Ron, scowling at her. â€œWould you mind leaving while we change?â€

â€œAll right â€” I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,â€ said Hermione in a sniffy voice. â€œAnd youâ€™ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?â€

Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.

He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ronâ€™s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.

A voice echoed through the train: â€œWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutesâ€™ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.â€

Harryâ€™s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.

The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: â€œFirsâ€™ years! Firsâ€™ years over here! All right there, Harry?â€

Hagridâ€™s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.

â€œCâ€™mon, follow me â€” any more firsâ€™ years? Mind yer step, now! Firsâ€™ years follow me!â€

Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.

â€œYehâ€™ll get yer firsâ€™ sight oâ€™ Hogwarts in a sec,â€ Hagrid called over his shoulder, â€œjusâ€™ round this bend here.â€

There was a loud â€œOooooh!â€

The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.

â€œNo moreâ€™n four to a boat!â€ Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.

â€œEveryone in?â€ shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. â€œRight then â€” FORWARD!â€

And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.

â€œHeads down!â€ yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.

â€œOy, you there! Is this your toad?â€ said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.

â€œTrevor!â€ cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagridâ€™s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.

â€œEveryone here? You there, still got yer toad?â€

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER SEVEN




THE SORTING HAT



T he door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harryâ€™s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.

â€œThe firsâ€™ years, Professor McGonagall,â€ said Hagrid.

â€œThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.â€

She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleysâ€™ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.

They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right â€” the rest of the school must already be here â€” but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.

â€œWelcome to Hogwarts,â€ said Professor McGonagall. â€œThe start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.

â€œThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.

â€œThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.â€

Her eyes lingered for a moment on Nevilleâ€™s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ronâ€™s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.

â€œI shall return when we are ready for you,â€ said Professor McGonagall. â€œPlease wait quietly.â€

She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.

â€œHow exactly do they sort us into houses?â€ he asked Ron.

â€œSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.â€

Harryâ€™s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didnâ€™t know any magic yet â€”what on earth would he have to do? He hadnâ€™t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells sheâ€™d learned and wondering which one sheâ€™d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. Heâ€™d never been more nervous, never, not even when heâ€™d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that heâ€™d somehow turned his teacherâ€™s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.

Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air â€” several people behind him screamed.

â€œWhat the â€”?â€

He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: â€œForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance â€”â€

â€œMy dear Friar, havenâ€™t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, heâ€™s not really even a ghost â€” I say, what are you all doing here?â€

A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.

Nobody answered.

â€œNew students!â€ said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. â€œAbout to be Sorted, I suppose?â€

A few people nodded mutely.

â€œHope to see you in Hufflepuff!â€ said the Friar. â€œMy old house, you know.â€

â€œMove along now,â€ said a sharp voice. â€œThe Sorting Ceremonyâ€™s about to start.â€

Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.

â€œNow, form a line,â€ Professor McGonagall told the first years, â€œand follow me.â€

Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.

Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, â€œIts bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.â€

It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didnâ€™t simply open on to the heavens.

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizardâ€™s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldnâ€™t have let it in the house.

Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing â€” noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth â€” and the hat began to sing:



â€œOh, you may not think Iâ€™m pretty,

But donâ€™t judge on what you see,

Iâ€™ll eat myself if you can find

A smarter hat than me.

You can keep your bowlers black,

Your top hats sleek and tall,

For Iâ€™m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat

And I can cap them all.

Thereâ€™s nothing hidden in your head

The Sorting Hat canâ€™t see,

So try me on and I will tell you

Where you ought to be.

You might belong in Gryffindor,

Where dwell the brave at heart,

Their daring, nerve, and chivalry

Set Gryffindors apart;

You might belong in Hufflepuff,

Where they are just and loyal,

Those patient Hufflepuffs are true

And unafraid of toil;

Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,

if youâ€™ve a ready mind,

Where those of wit and learning,

Will always find their kind;

Or perhaps in Slytherin

Youâ€™ll make your real friends,

Those cunning folk use any means

To achieve their ends.

So put me on! Donâ€™t be afraid!

And donâ€™t get in a flap!

Youâ€™re in safe hands (though I have none)

For Iâ€™m a Thinking Cap!â€



The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.

â€œSo weâ€™ve just got to try on the hat!â€ Ron whispered to Harry. â€œIâ€™ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.â€

Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didnâ€™t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.

Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.

â€œWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,â€ she said. â€œAbbott, Hannah!â€

A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause â€”

â€œHUFFLEPUFF!â€ shouted the hat.

The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.

â€œBones, Susan!â€

â€œHUFFLEPUFF!â€ shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.

â€œBoot, Terry!â€

â€œRAVENCLAW!â€

The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.

â€œBrocklehurst, Mandyâ€ went to Ravenclaw too, but â€œBrown, Lavenderâ€ became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ronâ€™s twin brothers catcalling.

â€œBulstrode, Millicentâ€ then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harryâ€™s imagination, after all heâ€™d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.

He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.

â€œFinch-Fletchley, Justin!â€

â€œHUFFLEPUFF!â€

Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. â€œFinnigan, Seamus,â€ the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.

â€œGranger, Hermione!â€

Her mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.

â€œGRYFFINDOR!â€ shouted the hat. Ron groaned.

A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when youâ€™re very nervous. What if he wasnâ€™t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and heâ€™d better get back on the train?

When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, â€œGRYFFINDOR,â€ Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to â€œMacDougal, Morag.â€

Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, â€œSLYTHERIN!â€

Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.

There werenâ€™t many people left now. â€œMoonâ€â€¦, â€œNottâ€â€¦, â€œParkinsonâ€â€¦, then a pair of twin girls, â€œPatilâ€ and â€œPatilâ€â€¦, then â€œPerks, Sally-Anneâ€â€¦, and then, at last â€”

â€œPotter, Harry!â€

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.

â€œPotter, did she say?â€

â€œThe Harry Potter?â€

The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.

â€œHmm,â€ said a small voice in his ear. â€œDifficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. Thereâ€™s talent, A my goodness, yes â€” and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now thatâ€™s interestingâ€¦.So where shall I put you?â€

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.

â€œNot Slytherin, eh?â€ said the small voice. â€œAre you sure? You could be great, you know, itâ€™s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that â€” no? Well, if youâ€™re sure â€” better be GRYFFINDOR!â€

Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, â€œWe got Potter! We got Potter!â€ Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff heâ€™d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling heâ€™d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.

He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card heâ€™d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledoreâ€™s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.

And now there were only three people left to be sorted. â€œThomas, Dean,â€ a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. â€œTurpin, Lisa,â€ became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ronâ€™s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, â€œGRYFFINDOR!â€

Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.

â€œWell done, Ron, excellent,â€ said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as â€œZabini, Blaise,â€ was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.

Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.

Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.

â€œWelcome,â€ he said. â€œWelcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!

â€œThank you!â€

He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didnâ€™t know whether to laugh or not.

â€œIs he â€” a bit mad?â€ he asked Percy uncertainly.

â€œMad?â€ said Percy airily. â€œHeâ€™s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?â€

Harryâ€™s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.

The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but heâ€™d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.

â€œThat does look good,â€ said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.

â€œCanâ€™t you â€”?â€

â€œI havenâ€™t eaten for nearly five hundred years,â€ said the ghost. â€œI donâ€™t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.â€

â€œI know who you are!â€ said Ron suddenly. â€œMy brothers told me about you â€” youâ€™re Nearly Headless Nick!â€

â€œI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy â€”â€ the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.

â€œNearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?â€

Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasnâ€™t going at all the way he wanted.

â€œLike this,â€ he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, â€œSo â€” new Gryffindors! I hope youâ€™re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baronâ€™s becoming almost unbearable â€” heâ€™s the Slytherin ghost.â€

Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didnâ€™t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.

â€œHow did he get covered in blood?â€ asked Seamus with great interest.

â€œIâ€™ve never asked,â€ said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.

When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice puddingâ€¦

As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.

â€œIâ€™m half-and-half,â€ said Seamus. â€œMe dadâ€™s a Muggle. Mom didnâ€™t tell him she was a witch â€™til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.â€

The others laughed.

â€œWhat about you, Neville?â€ said Ron.

â€œWell, my gran brought me up and sheâ€™s a witch,â€ said Neville, â€œbut the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me â€” he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned â€” but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced â€” all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here â€” they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.â€

On Harryâ€™s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (â€œI do hope they start right away, thereâ€™s so much to learn, Iâ€™m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, itâ€™s supposed to be very difficult â€”â€; â€œYouâ€™ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing â€” â€).

Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.

It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrellâ€™s turban straight into Harryâ€™s eyes â€” and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harryâ€™s forehead.

â€œOuch!â€ Harry clapped a hand to his head.

â€œWhat is it?â€ asked Percy.

â€œN-nothing.â€

The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacherâ€™s look â€” a feeling that he didnâ€™t like Harry at all.

â€œWhoâ€™s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?â€ he asked Percy.

â€œOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder heâ€™s looking so nervous, thatâ€™s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesnâ€™t want to â€” everyone knows heâ€™s after Quirrellâ€™s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.â€

Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didnâ€™t look at him again.

At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.

â€œAhem â€” just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.

â€œFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.â€

Dumbledoreâ€™s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.

â€œI have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.

â€œQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.

â€œAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.â€

Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.

â€œHeâ€™s not serious?â€ he muttered to Percy.

â€œMust be,â€ said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. â€œItâ€™s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why weâ€™re not allowed to go somewhere â€” the forestâ€™s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.â€

â€œAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!â€ cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachersâ€™ smiles had become rather fixed.

Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.

â€œEveryone pick their favorite tune,â€ said Dumbledore, â€œand off we go!â€

And the school bellowed:

â€œHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,

Teach us something please,

Whether we be old and bald

Or young with scabby knees,

Our heads could do with filling

With some interesting stuff,

For now theyâ€™re bare and full of air,

Dead flies and bits of fluff,

So teach us things worth knowing,

Bring back what weâ€™ve forgot,

just do your best, weâ€™ll do the rest,

And learn until our brains all rot.â€



Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.

â€œAh, music,â€ he said, wiping his eyes. â€œA magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!â€

The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harryâ€™s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.

A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.

â€œPeeves,â€ Percy whispered to the first years. â€œA poltergeist.â€ He raised his voice, â€œPeeves â€” show yourself.â€

A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.

â€œDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?â€

There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.

â€œOooooooh!â€ he said, with an evil cackle. â€œIckle Firsties! What fun!â€

He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.

â€œGo away, Peeves, or the Baronâ€™ll hear about this, I mean it!â€ barked Percy.

Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Nevilleâ€™s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.

â€œYou want to watch out for Peeves,â€ said Percy, as they set off again. â€œThe Bloody Baronâ€™s the only one who can control him, he wonâ€™t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.â€

At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.

â€œPassword?â€ she said.

â€œCaput Draconis,â€ said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it â€” Neville needed a leg up â€” and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.

Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase â€” they were obviously in one of the towers â€” they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.

â€œGreat food, isnâ€™t it?â€ Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. â€œGet off, Scabbers! Heâ€™s chewing my sheets.â€

Harry was going to ask Ron if heâ€™d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.

Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrellâ€™s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didnâ€™t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully â€” and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it â€” then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold â€” there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.

He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didnâ€™t remember the dream at all.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER EIGHT




THE POTIONS MASTER



T here, look.â€

â€œWhere?â€

â€œNext to the tall kid with the red hair.â€

â€œWearing the glasses?â€

â€œDid you see his face?â€

â€œDid you see his scar?â€

Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldnâ€™t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.

There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldnâ€™t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that werenâ€™t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.

The ghosts didnâ€™t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, â€œGOT YOUR CONK!â€

Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldnâ€™t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.

Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filchâ€™s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and sheâ€™d whisk off for Filch, whoâ€™d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.

And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.

They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.

Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harryâ€™s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.

Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasnâ€™t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.

â€œTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,â€ she said. â€œAnyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.â€

Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldnâ€™t wait to get started, but soon realized they werenâ€™t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.

The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrellâ€™s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire heâ€™d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they werenâ€™t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.

Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnâ€™t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadnâ€™t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didnâ€™t have much of a head start.

Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.

â€œWhat have we got today?â€ Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.

â€œDouble Potions with the Slytherins,â€ said Ron. â€œSnapeâ€™s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them â€” weâ€™ll be able to see if itâ€™s true.â€

â€œWish McGonagall favored us,â€ said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadnâ€™t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.

Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.

Hedwig hadnâ€™t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harryâ€™s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:



Dear Harry,

I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?

I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.

Hagrid



Harry borrowed Ronâ€™s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.

It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.

At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew heâ€™d been wrong. Snape didnâ€™t dislike Harry â€” he hated him.

Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.

Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harryâ€™s name.

â€œAh, Yes,â€ he said softly, â€œHarry Potter. Our new â€” celebrity.â€

Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagridâ€™s, but they had none of Hagridâ€™s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.

â€œYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,â€ he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word â€” like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. â€œAs there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I donâ€™t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.â€¦I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death â€” if you arenâ€™t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.â€

More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnâ€™t a dunderhead.

â€œPotter!â€ said Snape suddenly. â€œWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?â€

Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermioneâ€™s hand had shot into the air.

â€œI donâ€™t know, sir,â€ said Harry.

Snapeâ€™s lips curled into a sneer.

â€œTut, tut â€” fame clearly isnâ€™t everything.â€

He ignored Hermioneâ€™s hand.

â€œLetâ€™s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?â€

Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didnâ€™t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.

â€œI donâ€™t know, sir.â€

â€œThought you wouldnâ€™t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?â€ Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleysâ€™, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?

Snape was still ignoring Hermioneâ€™s quivering hand.

â€œWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?â€

At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Harry quietly. â€œI think Hermione does, though, why donâ€™t you try her?â€

A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamusâ€™s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.

â€œSit down,â€ he snapped at Hermione. â€œFor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why arenâ€™t you all copying that down?â€

There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, â€œAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.â€

Things didnâ€™t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamusâ€™s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in peopleâ€™s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.

â€œIdiot boy!â€ snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. â€œI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?â€

Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.

â€œTake him up to the hospital wing,â€ Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.

â€œYou â€” Potter â€” why didnâ€™t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought heâ€™d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? Thatâ€™s another point youâ€™ve lost for Gryffindor.â€

This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.

â€œDonâ€™t push it,â€ he muttered, â€œIâ€™ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.â€

As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harryâ€™s mind was racing and his spirits were low. Heâ€™d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week â€” why did Snape hate him so much?

â€œCheer up,â€ said Ron, â€œSnapeâ€™s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?â€

At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.

When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagridâ€™s voice rang out, saying, â€œBack, Fang â€” back.â€

Hagridâ€™s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.

â€œHang on,â€ he said. â€œBack, Fang.â€

He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.

There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.

â€œMake yerselves at home,â€ said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.

â€œThis is Ron,â€ Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.

â€œAnother Weasley, eh?â€ said Hagrid, glancing at Ronâ€™s freckles. I spent half me life chasinâ€™ yer twin brothers away from the forest.â€

The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harryâ€™s knee and drooled all over his robes.

Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch â€œthat old git.â€

â€œAnâ€™ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, Iâ€™d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. Dâ€™yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Canâ€™t get rid of her â€” Filch puts her up to it.â€

Harry told Hagrid about Snapeâ€™s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.

â€œBut he seemed to really hate me.â€

â€œRubbish!â€ said Hagrid. â€œWhy should he?â€

Yet Harry couldnâ€™t help thinking that Hagrid didnâ€™t quite meet his eyes when he said that.

â€œHowâ€™s yer brother Charlie?â€ Hagrid asked Ron. â€œI liked him a lot â€” great with animals.â€

Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlieâ€™s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:



GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST

Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.

Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.

â€œBut weâ€™re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know whatâ€™s good for you,â€ said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.



Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadnâ€™t mentioned the date.

â€œHagrid!â€ said Harry, â€œthat Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It mightâ€™ve been happening while we were there!â€

There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didnâ€™t meet Harryâ€™s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?

As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyâ€™d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons heâ€™d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didnâ€™t want to tell Harry?





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER NINE




THE MIDNIGHT DUEL



H arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didnâ€™t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didnâ€™t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday â€” and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.

â€œTypical,â€ said Harry darkly. â€œJust what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.â€

He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.

â€œYou donâ€™t know that youâ€™ll make a fool of yourself,â€ said Ron reasonably. â€œAnyway, I know Malfoyâ€™s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet thatâ€™s all talk.â€

Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasnâ€™t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, heâ€™d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone whoâ€™d listen about the time heâ€™d almost hit a hang glider on Charlieâ€™s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldnâ€™t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Deanâ€™s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.

Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt sheâ€™d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.

Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldnâ€™t learn by heart out of a book â€” not that she hadnâ€™t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips sheâ€™d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermioneâ€™s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.

Harry hadnâ€™t had a single letter since Hagridâ€™s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoyâ€™s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.

A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.

â€œItâ€™s a Remembrall!â€ he explained. â€œGran knows I forget things â€” this tells you if thereâ€™s something youâ€™ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red â€” ohâ€¦â€ His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, â€œâ€¦youâ€™ve forgotten somethingâ€¦.â€

Neville was trying to remember what heâ€™d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.

Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.

â€œWhatâ€™s going on?â€

â€œMalfoyâ€™s got my Remembrall, Professor.â€

Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.

â€œJust looking,â€ he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.



At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.

The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.

Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.

â€œWell, what are you all waiting for?â€ she barked. â€œEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.â€

Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.

â€œStick out your right hand over your broom,â€ called Madam Hooch at the front, â€œand say â€˜Up!â€™â€

â€œUPâ€ everyone shouted.

Harryâ€™s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Grangerâ€™s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Nevilleâ€™s hadnâ€™t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Nevilleâ€™s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.

Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy heâ€™d been doing it wrong for years.

â€œNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,â€ said Madam Hooch. â€œKeep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle â€” three â€” two â€”â€

But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hoochâ€™s lips.

â€œCome back, boy!â€ she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle â€” twelve feet â€” twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and â€”

WHAM â€” a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.

Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.

â€œBroken wrist,â€ Harry heard her mutter. â€œCome on, boy â€” itâ€™s all right, up you get.â€

She turned to the rest of the class.

â€œNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or youâ€™ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say â€˜Quidditch.â€™ Come on, dear.â€

Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.

No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.

â€œDid you see his face, the great lump?â€

The other Slytherins joined in.

â€œShut up, Malfoy,â€ snapped Parvati Patil.

â€œOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?â€ said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. â€œNever thought youâ€™d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.â€

â€œLook!â€ said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. â€œItâ€™s that stupid thing Longbottomâ€™s gran sent him.â€

The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.

â€œGive that here, Malfoy,â€ said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.

Malfoy smiled nastily.

â€œI think Iâ€™ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find â€” how about â€” up a tree?â€

â€œGive it here!â€ Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadnâ€™t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, â€œCome and get it, Potter!â€

Harry grabbed his broom.

â€œNo!â€ shouted Hermione Granger. â€œMadam Hooch told us not to move â€” youâ€™ll get us all into trouble.â€

Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him â€” and in a rush of fierce joy he realized heâ€™d found something he could do without being taught â€” this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.

He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.

â€œGive it here,â€ Harry called, â€œor Iâ€™ll knock you off that broom!â€

â€œOh, yeah?â€ said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.

Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.

â€œNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,â€ Harry called.

The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.

â€œCatch it if you can, then!â€ he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.

Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down â€” next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball â€” wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching â€” he stretched out his hand â€” a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.

â€œHARRY POTTER!â€

His heart sank faster than heâ€™d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.

â€œNever â€” in all my time at Hogwarts â€”â€

Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, â€œâ€” how dare you â€” might have broken your neck â€”â€

â€œIt wasnâ€™t his fault, Professor â€”â€

â€œBe quiet, Miss Patil â€”â€

â€œBut Malfoy â€”â€

â€œThatâ€™s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.â€

Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyleâ€™s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagallâ€™s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now heâ€™d done it. He hadnâ€™t even lasted two weeks. Heâ€™d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?

Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didnâ€™t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagridâ€™s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagridâ€™s bag.

Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.

â€œExcuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?â€

Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?

But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwickâ€™s class looking confused.

â€œFollow me, you two,â€ said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.

â€œIn here.â€

Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.

â€œOut, Peeves!â€ she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.

â€œPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood â€” Iâ€™ve found you a Seeker.â€

Woodâ€™s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.

â€œAre you serious, Professor?â€

â€œAbsolutely,â€ said Professor McGonagall crisply. â€œThe boyâ€™s a natural. Iâ€™ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?â€

Harry nodded silently. He didnâ€™t have a clue what was going on, but he didnâ€™t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.

â€œHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,â€ Professor McGonagall told Wood. â€œDidnâ€™t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldnâ€™t have done it.â€

Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.

â€œEver seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?â€ he asked excitedly.

â€œWoodâ€™s captain of the Gryffindor team,â€ Professor McGonagall explained.

â€œHeâ€™s just the build for a Seeker, too,â€ said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. â€œLight â€”speedy â€” weâ€™ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor â€” a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, Iâ€™d say.â€

â€œI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we canâ€™t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldnâ€™t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.â€¦â€

Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.

â€œI want to hear youâ€™re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.â€

Then she suddenly smiled.

â€œYour father would have been proud,â€ she said. â€œHe was an excellent Quidditch player himself.â€



â€œYouâ€™re joking.â€

It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when heâ€™d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but heâ€™d forgotten all about it.

â€œSeeker?â€ he said. â€œBut first years never â€” you must be the youngest house player in about â€”â€

â€œ â€” a century,â€ said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. â€œWood told me.â€

Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.

â€œI start training next week,â€ said Harry. â€œOnly donâ€™t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.â€

Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.

â€œWell done,â€ said George in a low voice. â€œWood told us. Weâ€™re on the team too â€” Beaters.â€

â€œI tell you, weâ€™re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,â€ said Fred. â€œWe havenâ€™t won since Charlie left, but this yearâ€™s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.â€

â€œAnyway, weâ€™ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons heâ€™s found a new secret passageway out of the school.â€

â€œBet itâ€™s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.â€

Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

â€œHaving a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?â€

â€œYouâ€™re a lot braver now that youâ€™re back on the ground and youâ€™ve got your little friends with you,â€ said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.

â€œIâ€™d take you on anytime on my own,â€ said Malfoy. â€œTonight, if you want. Wizardâ€™s duel. Wands only â€” no contact. Whatâ€™s the matter? Never heard of a wizardâ€™s duel before, I suppose?â€

â€œOf course he has,â€ said Ron, wheeling around. â€œIâ€™m his second, whoâ€™s yours?â€

Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.

â€œCrabbe,â€ he said. â€œMidnight all right? Weâ€™ll meet you in the trophy room; thatâ€™s always unlocked.â€

When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.

â€œWhat is a wizardâ€™s duel?â€ said Harry. â€œAnd what do you mean, youâ€™re my second?â€

â€œWell, a secondâ€™s there to take over if you die,â€ said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harryâ€™s face, he added quickly, â€œBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoyâ€™ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.â€

â€œAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?â€

â€œThrow it away and punch him on the nose,â€ Ron suggested.

â€œExcuse me.â€

They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.

â€œCanâ€™t a person eat in peace in this place?â€ said Ron.

Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.

â€œI couldnâ€™t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying â€”â€

â€œBet you could,â€ Ron muttered.

â€œâ€” and you mustnâ€™t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points youâ€™ll lose Gryffindor if youâ€™re caught, and youâ€™re bound to be. Itâ€™s really very selfish of you.â€

â€œAnd itâ€™s really none of your business,â€ said Harry.

â€œGood-bye,â€ said Ron.



All the same, it wasnâ€™t what youâ€™d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasnâ€™t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as â€œIf he tries to curse you, youâ€™d better dodge it, because I canâ€™t remember how to block them.â€ There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoyâ€™s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness â€” this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldnâ€™t miss it.

â€œHalf-past eleven,â€ Ron muttered at last, â€œweâ€™d better go.â€

They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, â€œI canâ€™t believe youâ€™re going to do this, Harry.â€

A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.

â€œYou!â€ said Ron furiously. â€œGo back to bed!â€

â€œI almost told your brother,â€ Hermione snapped, â€œPercy â€” heâ€™s a prefect, heâ€™d put a stop to this.â€

Harry couldnâ€™t believe anyone could be so interfering.

â€œCome on,â€ he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.

Hermione wasnâ€™t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.

â€œDonâ€™t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I donâ€™t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and youâ€™ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.â€

â€œGo away.â€

â€œAll right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when youâ€™re on the train home tomorrow, youâ€™re so â€”â€

But what they were, they didnâ€™t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.

â€œNow what am I going to do?â€ she asked shrilly.

â€œThatâ€™s your problem,â€ said Ron. â€œWeâ€™ve got to go, weâ€™re going to be late.â€

They hadnâ€™t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.

â€œIâ€™m coming with you,â€ she said.

â€œYou are not.â€

â€œDâ€™you think Iâ€™m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us Iâ€™ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.â€

â€œYouâ€™ve got some nerve â€”â€ said Ron loudly.

â€œShut up, both of you!â€ said Harry sharply. I heard something.â€

It was a sort of snuffling.

â€œMrs. Norris?â€ breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.

It wasnâ€™t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.

â€œThank goodness you found me! Iâ€™ve been out here for hours, I couldnâ€™t remember the new password to get in to bed.â€

â€œKeep your voice down, Neville. The passwordâ€™s â€˜Pig snoutâ€™ but it wonâ€™t help you now, the Fat Ladyâ€™s gone off somewhere.â€

â€œHowâ€™s your arm?â€ said Harry.

â€œFine,â€ said Neville, showing them. â€œMadam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.â€

â€œGood â€” well, look, Neville, weâ€™ve got to be somewhere, weâ€™ll see you later â€”â€

â€œDonâ€™t leave me!â€ said Neville, scrambling to his feet, â€œI donâ€™t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baronâ€™s been past twice already.â€

Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.

â€œIf either of you get us caught, Iâ€™ll never rest until Iâ€™ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.â€

Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.

They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.

Malfoy and Crabbe werenâ€™t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.

â€œHeâ€™s late, maybe heâ€™s chickened out,â€ Ron whispered.

Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak â€” and it wasnâ€™t Malfoy.

â€œSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.â€

It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filchâ€™s voice. Nevilleâ€™s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.

â€œTheyâ€™re in here somewhere,â€ they heard him mutter, â€œprobably hiding.â€

â€œThis way!â€ Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.

â€œRUN!â€ Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following â€” they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going â€” they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.

â€œI think weâ€™ve lost him,â€ Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.

I â€” told â€” you,â€ Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, â€œI â€” told â€” you.â€

â€œWeâ€™ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,â€ said Ron, â€œquickly as possible.â€

â€œMalfoy tricked you,â€ Hermione said to Harry. â€œYou realize that, donâ€™t you? He was never going to meet you â€” Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.â€

Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasnâ€™t going to tell her that.

â€œLetâ€™s go.â€

It wasnâ€™t going to be that simple. They hadnâ€™t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.

It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.

â€œShut up, Peeves â€” please â€” youâ€™ll get us thrown out.â€

Peeves cackled.

â€œWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, youâ€™ll get caughty.â€

â€œNot if you donâ€™t give us away, Peeves, please.â€

â€œShould tell Filch, I should,â€ said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. â€œItâ€™s for your own good, you know.â€

â€œGet out of the way,â€ snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.

â€œSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!â€ Peeves bellowed, â€œSTUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!â€

Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door â€” and it was locked.

â€œThis is it!â€ Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, â€œWeâ€™re done for! This is the end!â€

They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peevesâ€™s shouts.

â€œOh, move over,â€ Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harryâ€™s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, â€œAlohomora!â€

The lock clicked and the door swung open â€” they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.

â€œWhich way did they go, Peeves?â€ Filch was saying. â€œQuick, tell me.â€

â€œSay â€˜please.â€™â€

â€œDonâ€™t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?â€

â€œShanâ€™t say nothing if you donâ€™t say please,â€ said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.

â€œAll right â€” please.â€

â€œNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldnâ€™t say nothing if you didnâ€™t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!â€ And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.

â€œHe thinks this door is locked,â€ Harry whispered. â€œI think weâ€™ll be okay â€” get off, Neville!â€ For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harryâ€™s bathrobe for the last minute. â€œWhat?â€

Harry turned around â€” and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure heâ€™d walked into a nightmare â€” this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.

They werenâ€™t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.

They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.

It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they werenâ€™t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.

Harry groped for the doorknob â€” between Filch and death, heâ€™d take Filch.

They fell backward â€” Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didnâ€™t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared â€” all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didnâ€™t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.

â€œWhere on earth have you all been?â€ she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.

â€œNever mind that â€” pig snout, pig snout,â€ panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.

It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if heâ€™d never speak again.

â€œWhat do they think theyâ€™re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?â€ said Ron finally. â€œIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.â€

Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. â€œYou donâ€™t use your eyes, any of you, do you?â€ she snapped. â€œDidnâ€™t you see what it was standing on.

â€œThe floor?â€ Harry suggested. â€œI wasnâ€™t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.â€

â€œNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. Itâ€™s obviously guarding something.â€

She stood up, glaring at them.

â€œI hope youâ€™re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed â€” or worse, expelled. Now, if you donâ€™t mind, Iâ€™m going to bed.â€

Ron stared after her, his mouth open.

â€œNo, we donâ€™t mind,â€ he said. â€œYouâ€™d think we dragged her along, wouldnâ€™t you.

But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding somethingâ€¦What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide â€” except perhaps Hogwarts.

It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.





HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone





CHAPTER TEN




HALLOWEEN



M alfoy couldnâ€™t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.

â€œItâ€™s either really valuable or really dangerous,â€ said Ron.

â€œOr both,â€ said Harry.

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didnâ€™t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.

Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.

Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.

As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyoneâ€™s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.

Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:



DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.

It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I donâ€™t want everybody knowing youâ€™ve got a broomstick or theyâ€™ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven oâ€™clock for your first training session.



Professor McGonagall



Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.

â€œA Nimbus Two Thousand!â€ Ron moaned enviously. â€œIâ€™ve never even touched one.â€

They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.

â€œThatâ€™s a broomstick,â€ he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. â€œYouâ€™ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years arenâ€™t allowed them.â€

Ron couldnâ€™t resist it.

â€œItâ€™s not any old broomstick,â€ he said, â€œitâ€™s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say youâ€™ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?â€ Ron grinned at Harry. â€œComets look flashy, but theyâ€™re not in the same league as the Nimbus.â€

â€œWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldnâ€™t afford half the handle,â€ Malfoy snapped back. â€œI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.â€

Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoyâ€™s elbow.

â€œNot arguing, I hope, boys?â€ he squeaked.

â€œPotterâ€™s been sent a broomstick, Professor,â€ said Malfoy quickly.

â€œYes, yes, thatâ€™s right,â€ said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. â€œProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?â€

â€œA Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,â€ said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoyâ€™s face. â€œAnd itâ€™s really thanks to Malfoy here that Iâ€™ve got it,â€ he added.

Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoyâ€™s obvious rage and confusion.

â€œWell, itâ€™s true,â€ Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, â€œIf he hadnâ€™t stolen Nevilleâ€™s Remembrall I wouldnâ€™t be on the team.â€¦â€

â€œSo I suppose you think thatâ€™s a reward for breaking rules?â€ came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harryâ€™s hand.

â€œI thought you werenâ€™t speaking to us?â€ said Harry.

â€œYes, donâ€™t stop now,â€ said Ron, â€œitâ€™s doing us so much good.â€

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.

Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where heâ€™d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.

â€œWow,â€ Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harryâ€™s bedspread.

Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.

As seven oâ€™clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.

Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling â€” he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.

â€œHey, Potter, come down!â€

Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.

â€œVery nice,â€ said Wood, his eyes glinting. â€œI see what McGonagall meantâ€¦you really are a natural. Iâ€™m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then youâ€™ll be joining team practice three times a week.â€

He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.

â€œRight,â€ said Wood. â€œNow, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if itâ€™s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.â€

â€œThree Chasers,â€ Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.

â€œThis ballâ€™s called the Quaffle,â€ said Wood. â€œThe Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?â€

â€œThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,â€ Harry recited. â€œSo â€” thatâ€™s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œWhatâ€™s basketball?â€ said Wood curiously.

â€œNever mind,â€ said Harry quickly.

â€œNow, thereâ€™s another player on each side whoâ€™s called the Keeper â€” Iâ€™m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.â€

â€œThree Chasers, one Keeper,â€ said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. â€œAnd they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?â€ He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.

â€œIâ€™ll show you now,â€ said Wood. â€œTake this.â€

He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.

â€œIâ€™m going to show you what the Bludgers do,â€ Wood said. â€œThese two are the Bludgers.â€

He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.

â€œStand back,â€ Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.

At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harryâ€™s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air â€” it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.

â€œSee?â€ Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. â€œThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. Thatâ€™s why you have two Beaters on each team â€” the Weasley twins are ours â€” itâ€™s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So â€” think youâ€™ve got all that?â€

â€œThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,â€ Harry reeled off.

â€œVery good,â€ said Wood.

â€œEr â€” have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?â€ Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.

â€œNever at Hogwarts. Weâ€™ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. Thatâ€™s you. And you donâ€™t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers â€”â€

â€œâ€” unless they crack my head open.â€

â€œDonâ€™t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers â€” I mean, theyâ€™re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.â€

Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.

â€œThis,â€ said Wood, â€œis the Golden Snitch, and itâ€™s the most important ball of the lot. Itâ€™s very hard to catch because itâ€™s so fast and difficult to see. Itâ€™s the Seekerâ€™s job to catch it. Youâ€™ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other teamâ€™s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. Thatâ€™s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages â€” I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.

â€œWell, thatâ€™s it any questions?â€

Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.

â€œWe wonâ€™t practice with the Snitch yet,â€ said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, â€œitâ€™s too dark, we might lose it. Letâ€™s try you out with a few of these.â€

He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.

Harry didnâ€™t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldnâ€™t carry on.

â€œThat Quidditch Cupâ€™ll have our name on it this year,â€ said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. â€œI wouldnâ€™t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadnâ€™t gone off chasing dragons.â€



Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that heâ€™d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.

On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since theyâ€™d seen him make Nevilleâ€™s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harryâ€™s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadnâ€™t spoken to either of them since the day Harryâ€™s broomstick had arrived.

â€œNow, donâ€™t forget that nice wrist movement weâ€™ve been practicing!â€ squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. â€œSwish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too â€” never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said â€˜sâ€™ instead of â€˜fâ€™ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.â€

It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it â€” Harry had to put it out with his hat.

Ron, at the next table, wasnâ€™t having much more luck.

â€œWingardium Leviosa!â€ he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.

â€œYouâ€™re saying it wrong,â€ Harry heard Hermione snap. â€œItâ€™s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the â€˜garâ€™ nice and long.â€

â€œYou do it, then, if youâ€™re so clever,â€ Ron snarled.

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, â€œWingardium Leviosa!â€

Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.

â€œOh, well done!â€ cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. â€œEveryone see here, Miss Grangerâ€™s done it!â€

Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.

â€œItâ€™s no wonder no one can stand her,â€ he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, â€œsheâ€™s a nightmare, honestly.â€

Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face â€” and was startled to see that she was in tears.

â€œI think she heard you.â€

â€œSo?â€ said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. â€œShe mustâ€™ve noticed sheâ€™s got no friends.â€

Hermione didnâ€™t turn up for the next class and wasnâ€™t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girlsâ€™ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.

Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledoreâ€™s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, â€œTroll â€” in the dungeons â€” thought you ought to know.â€

He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.

There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledoreâ€™s wand to bring silence.

â€œPrefects,â€ he rumbled, â€œlead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!â€

Percy was in his element.

â€œFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, Iâ€™m a prefect!â€

â€œHow could a troll get in?â€ Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.

â€œDonâ€™t ask me, theyâ€™re supposed to be really stupid,â€ said Ron. â€œMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.â€

They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ronâ€™s arm.

â€œIâ€™ve just thought â€” Hermione.â€

â€œWhat about her?â€

â€œShe doesnâ€™t know about the troll.â€

Ron bit his lip.

â€œOh, all right,â€ he snapped. â€œBut Percyâ€™d better not see us.â€

Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girlsâ€™ bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.

â€œPercy!â€ hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.

â€œWhatâ€™s he doing?â€ Harry whispered. â€œWhy isnâ€™t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?â€

â€œSearch me.â€

Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snapeâ€™s fading footsteps.

â€œHeâ€™s heading for the third floor,â€ Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.

â€œCan you smell something?â€

Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.

And then they heard it â€” a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed â€” at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.

It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.

The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.

â€œThe keys in the lock,â€ Harry muttered. â€œWe could lock it in.â€

â€œGood idea,â€ said Ron nervously.

They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasnâ€™t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.

â€œYes!â€

Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop â€” a high, petrified scream â€” and it was coming from the chamber theyâ€™d just chained up.

â€œOh, no,â€ said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.

â€œItâ€™s the girlsâ€™ bathroom!â€ Harry gasped.

â€œHermione!â€ they said together.

It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.

Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.

â€œConfuse it!â€ Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.

The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.

â€œOy, pea-brain!â€ yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didnâ€™t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.

â€œCome on, run, run!â€ Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldnâ€™t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.

Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trollâ€™s neck from behind. The troll couldnâ€™t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harryâ€™s wand had still been in his hand when heâ€™d jumped â€“ it had gone straight up one of the trollâ€™s nostrils.

Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.

Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand â€” not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: â€œWingardium Leviosa!â€

The club flew suddenly out of the trollâ€™s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over â€” and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its ownerâ€™s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.

Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.

It was Hermione who spoke first.

â€œIs it â€” dead?â€

â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ said Harry, I think itâ€™s just been knocked out.â€

He bent down and pulled his wand out of the trollâ€™s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.

â€œUrgh â€” troll boogers.â€

He wiped it on the trollâ€™s trousers.

A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadnâ€™t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trollâ€™s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.

Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harryâ€™s mind.

â€œWhat on earth were you thinking of?â€ said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. â€œYouâ€™re lucky you werenâ€™t killed. Why arenâ€™t you in your dormitory?â€

Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.

Then a small voice came out of the shadows.

â€œPlease, Professor McGonagall â€” they were looking for me.â€

â€œMiss Granger!â€

Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.

â€œI went looking for the troll because I â€” I thought I could deal with it on my own â€” you know, because Iâ€™ve read all about them.â€

Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?

â€œIf they hadnâ€™t found me, Iâ€™d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didnâ€™t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.â€

Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasnâ€™t new to them.

â€œWell â€” in that case ...â€ said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, â€œMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?â€

Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.

â€œMiss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,â€ said Professor McGonagall. â€œIâ€™m very disappointed in you. If youâ€™re not hurt at all, youâ€™d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.â€

Hermione left.

Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.

â€œWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.â€

They hurried out of the chamber and didnâ€™t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.
